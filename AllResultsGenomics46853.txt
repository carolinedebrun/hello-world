AB  - Over 15-months we found that anti-spike RBD SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations follow different trends with combinations and permutations of COVID-19 infection and vaccination among healthcare workers in Boston, MA. A majority of HCWs remain well above the positivity threshold for anti-spike RBD IgG antibodies for at least 9 months following vaccination regardless of infection history. Of interest, those with COVID-19 infection before vaccination had significantly higher median serum antibody concentrations in comparison to HCWs with no prior infection at each follow-up timepoint. These findings further support what is known regarding the decline in serum antibody concentrations following natural infection and vaccination, adding knowledge of serum antibodies up to 15 months post infection and 11 months post vaccination. ImportanceBoston Medical Center (BMC) is a safety net hospital in Boston and from the initial wave of COVID-19 there has been overwhelming concern about the exposure of healthcare workers to SARS-CoV-2. We conceived a longitudinal study to assess virus exposure and trends in SARS-CoV-2 antibodies amongst healthcare workers at BMC over 15 months. We have followed HCWs through three waves of COVID-19, including the Delta variant wave from June through mid-December 2021, assessing anti-spike receptor binding domain IgG, anti-nucleocapsid IgG, and anti-spike IgM at approximately three-month intervals. Current literature largely describes antibody durability six months post vaccination. These data add to the literature by describing antibody durability and trend differences according to infection history and vaccination status. These longitudinal data contribute to a greater understanding of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and can help inform future research and public health decision-making regarding vaccine uptake, breakthrough infections, and overall pandemic response.

AB  - Variants of SARS-CoV-2 have mutations in the viral genome that may alter the accuracy of rapid diagnostic tests. We conducted analytical and clinical accuracy studies of two FDA-approved rapid antigen tests--SCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Test (InBios International, Seattle) and BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag CARD; (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago)--using three using replication-competent variants or strains, including Omicron (B.1.1.529/BA.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and a wild-type of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020). Overall, we found non-significant differences in the analytical limit of detection or clinical diagnostic accuracy of rapid antigen testing across SARS-CoV-2 variants. This study provides analytical and clinical performance data to demonstrate the preserved accuracy of rapid antigen testing across SARS-CoV-2 variants among symptomatic adults.

AB  - BackgroundLittle is known about the population prevalence of antibodies against emerging immune escape variants of SARS-CoV-2. MethodsA population-based prevalence study was conducted in Yokohama City, the most populous municipality of Japan. Quantitative measurements of immunoglobulin G against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP-IgG) and qualitative measurements of neutralization antibodies against the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants were performed. ResultsOf 6,000 randomly selected residents aged 20-74, 1,277 participated in the study during a period from January 30 to February 28, 2022. Of them, 3% had prior diagnosis of COVID-19, 96% received at least two-doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and 94% were positive for SP-IgG. The positive rates of neutralizing antibodies were 28% to Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants in a random sample of 10% of participants (n=123) and 100% to BA.1 and BA.2 among participants who received the third vaccination at least 7 days before (n=66). ConclusionsIn this population-based prevalence study in Japan, most had SP-IgG antibodies but the overall neutralizing antibody positive rate was 28% against the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants. The population-level insufficient humoral immunity against the Omicron variants may explain the outbreak of COVID-19 during this period in Japan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Binding and neutralising anti-Spike antibodies play a key role in immune defence against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since it is known that antibodies wane with time and new immune-evasive variants are emerging, we aimed to assess the dynamics of anti-Spike antibodies in an African adult population with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and to determine the effect of subsequent COVID-19 vaccination., METHODS: Using a prospective cohort design, we recruited adults with prior laboratory-confirmed mild/moderate COVID-19 in Blantyre, Malawi, and followed them up for 270 days (n = 52). A subset of whom subsequently received a single dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (ChAdOx nCov-19) (n = 12). We measured the serum concentrations of anti-Spike and receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies using a Luminex-based assay. Anti-RBD antibody cross-reactivity across SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) was measured using a haemagglutination test. A pseudovirus neutralisation assay was used to measure neutralisation titres across VOCs. Ordinary or repeated measures one-way ANOVA was used to compare log10 transformed data, with p value adjusted for multiple comparison using Sidak's or Holm-Sidak's test., RESULTS: We show that neutralising antibodies wane within 6 months post mild/moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection (30-60 days vs. 210-270 days; Log ID50 6.8 vs. 5.3, p = 0.0093). High levels of binding anti-Spike or anti-RBD antibodies in convalescent serum were associated with potent neutralisation activity against the homologous infecting strain (p < 0.0001). A single dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine following mild/moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a 2 to 3-fold increase in anti-Spike and -RBD IgG levels 30 days post-vaccination (both, p < 0.0001). The anti-RBD IgG antibodies from these vaccinated individuals were broadly cross-reactive against multiple VOCs and had neutralisation potency against original D614G, beta, and delta variants., CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is an effective booster for waning cross-variant antibody immunity after initial priming with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potency of hybrid immunity and its potential to maximise the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines needs to be taken into consideration when formulating vaccination policies in sub-Saharan Africa, where there is still limited access to vaccine doses.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic. With the continuous evolution of the viral genome, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved many variants. B.1.617.2, also called Delta, is one of the most concerned variants. The Delta variant was first reported in India at the end of 2020 but has spread globally, by now, to 135 countries and is not stand still. Delta shared some mutations with other variants, and owned its special mutations on spike proteins, which may be responsible for its strong transmission and increasing virulence. Under these circumstances, a systematic summary of Delta is necessary. This review will focus on the Delta variant. We will describe all the characteristics of Delta (including biological features and clinical characteristics), analyze potential reasons for its strong transmission, and provide potential protective ways for combating Delta.

AB  - The animal reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown despite reports of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses in Asian Rhinolophus bats1-4, including the closest virus from R. affinis, RaTG13 (refs. 5,6), and pangolins7-9. SARS-CoV-2 has a mosaic genome, to which different progenitors contribute. The spike sequence determines the binding affinity and accessibility of its receptor-binding domain to the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and is responsible for host range10-12. SARS-CoV-2 progenitor bat viruses genetically close to SARS-CoV-2 and able to enter human cells through a human ACE2 (hACE2) pathway have not yet been identified, although they would be key in understanding the origin of the epidemic. Here we show that such viruses circulate in cave bats living in the limestone karstic terrain in northern Laos, in the Indochinese peninsula. We found that the receptor-binding domains of these viruses differ from that of SARS-CoV-2 by only one or two residues at the interface with ACE2, bind more efficiently to the hACE2 protein than that of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated in Wuhan from early human cases, and mediate hACE2-dependent entry and replication in human cells, which is inhibited by antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2. None of these bat viruses contains a furin cleavage site in the spike protein. Our findings therefore indicate that bat-borne SARS-CoV-2-like viruses that are potentially infectious for humans circulate in Rhinolophus spp. in the Indochinese peninsula.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - The emergence of the new SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, which is known to accumulate a huge number of mutations when compared to other variants, brought to light the concern about vaccine escape, especially from the neutralization by antibodies induced by vaccination. In this scenario, we evaluated the impact on antibody neutralization induction, against Omicron variant, by a booster dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine after the CoronaVac primary vaccination scheme. The percentage of seroconverted individuals 30 and 60 days after CoronaVac scheme was 17% and 10%, respectively. After booster dose administration, the seroconvertion rate increased to 76.6%. The neutralization mean titer against Omicron in the CoronaVac protocol decreased over time, but after the booster dose, the mean titer increased 43.1 times, indicating a positive impact of this vaccine combination in the serological immune response.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus with a high mutation rate. The rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants could increase transmissibility and diminish vaccine protection. However, whether coinfection with multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants exists remains controversial. This study collected 12,986 and 4,113 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID database on May 11, 2020 (GISAID20May11), and Apr 1, 2021 (GISAID21Apr1), respectively. With single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and network clique analyses, we constructed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) coexistence networks and discovered maximal SNP cliques of sizes 16 and 34 in the GISAID20May11 and GISAID21Apr1 datasets, respectively. Simulating the transmission routes and SNV accumulations, we discovered a linear relationship between the size of the maximal clique and the number of coinfected variants. We deduced that the COVID-19 cases in GISAID20May11 and GISAID21Apr1 were coinfections with 3.20 and 3.42 variants on average, respectively. Additionally, we performed Nanopore sequencing on 42 COVID-19 patients and discovered recurrent heterozygous SNPs in twenty of the patients, including loci 8,782 and 28,144, which were crucial for SARS-CoV-2 lineage divergence. In conclusion, our findings reported SARS-CoV-2 variants coinfection in COVID-19 patients and demonstrated the increasing number of coinfected variants.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Previous clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that over time antibody titers decrease, and they do not provide long-term mucosa protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, the increase in breakthrough infections that occur more frequently in the vaccinated than in the study participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection has recently become a priority public health concern. We measured the amount of interferon-gamma (Quan-T-Cell ELISA) and the level of antibodies (Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA IgG) in the blood of the same patients simultaneously to compare cellular and humoral immunity. A total of 200 study participants (before Omicron variant appearance) were divided into four groups whose levels of cellular and humoral immunity we compared: study participants previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (group 1); study participants vaccinated with EMA-approved vaccines (group 2); study participants previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, and vaccination history (group 3); and study participants without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination (group 4). Our results showed that study participants who received one of the EMA-approved vaccines and who recovered from COVID-19 (group 3) had significantly higher levels of cellular immunity and antibody titers in comparison with groups 1 and 2. Additionally, we have noticed that the study participants previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the study participants vaccinated with EMA-approved vaccines had a long-lasting cellular immunity. Furthermore, antibody levels showed a negative correlation with time since the last contact with a viral antigen, while cellular immunity within 20 months showed as long-term protection. Moreover, out of 200 study participants, only 1 study participant who recovered from COVID-19 (0.5%) was re-infected, while a total of 6 study participants (3%) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 after receiving the vaccine. This study suggests that cellular immunity-unlike humoral immunity, thanks to memory T cells-represents long-term protection in individuals recovered from SARS-CoV-2 and after vaccination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 lineage and its sublineages (Omicron variant) pose a new challenge to healthcare systems worldwide due to its ability to efficiently spread in immunized populations and its resistance to currently available monoclonal antibody therapies. RT-PCR-based variant tests can be used to screen large sample-sets rapidly and accurately for relevant variants of concern (VOC). The aim of this study was to establish and validate a multiplex assay on the cobas 6800/8800 systems to allow discrimination between the two currently circulating VOCs, Omicron and Delta, in clinical samples., METHODS: Primers and probes were evaluated for multiplex compatibility. Analytic performance was assessed using cell culture supernatant of an Omicron variant isolate and a clinical Delta variant sample, normalized to WHO-Standard. Clinical performance of the multiplex assay was benchmarked against NGS results., RESULTS: In silico testing of all oligos showed no interactions with a high risk of primer-dimer formation or amplification of human DNA/RNA. Over 99.9% of all currently available Omicron variant sequences are a perfect match for at least one of the three Omicron targets included in the multiplex. Analytic sensitivity was determined as 19.0 IU/mL (CI95%: 12.9-132.2 IU/mL) for the A67V + del-HV69-70 target, 193.9 IU/mL (CI95%: 144.7-334.7 IU/mL) for the E484A target, 35.5 IU/mL (CI95%: 23.3-158.0 IU/mL) for the N679K + P681H target and 105.0 IU/mL (CI95%: 80.7-129.3 IU/mL) for the P681R target. All sequence variances were correctly detected in the clinical sample set (225/225 Targets)., CONCLUSION: RT-PCR-based variant screening compared to whole genome sequencing is both rapid and reliable in detecting relevant sequence variations in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples to exclude or verify relevant VOCs. This allows short-term decision-making, e.g., for patient treatment or public health measures.

AB  - Control and mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic in England has relied on a combination of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as closure of non-essential shops and leisure activities, closure of schools, social distancing, mask wearing, testing followed by isolation and general public health awareness. Some of these measures are extremely costly (both economically and socially), so it is important that they are relaxed promptly but without overwhelming already burdened health services. The eventual policy was a Roadmap of four relaxation steps throughout 2021, taking England from lock-down to the cessation of all restrictions on social interaction; with a minimum of five weeks between each step to allow the data to reflect the changes in restrictions and the results to analysed. Here we present a retrospective analysis of our six Roadmap documents generated in 2021 to assess the likely impacts of future relaxation steps in England. In each case we directly compare results generated at the time with more recent public health data (primarily hospital admissions, but also hospital occupancy and death) to understand discrepancies and potential improvements. We conclude that, in general, the model projections generated a reliable estimation of medium-term hospital admission trends, with the data points up to September 2021 generally lying within our 95% projection intervals. The greatest uncertainties in the modelled scenarios came from estimates of vaccine efficacy, hampered by the lack of data in the early stages of the Alpha and Delta variant waves, and from assumptions about human behaviour in the face of changing restrictions and changing risk. These are clearly avenues for future study.

AB  - The Delta variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a new global wave of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 vaccines currently available in China show high effectiveness against severe illness and death. However, transmission of the virus is not fully stopped by vaccination alone, therefore, integrated vaccination and non-pharmacological interventions is necessary to prevent and control the epidemic in the near future. Further expanded vaccine coverage of primary doses as well as booster shots in China's domestic population are needed to reduce severe illness and death. In order to provide evidence necessary for adjusting and optimizing immunization strategies and pandemic control measures, it is essential to conduct research on vaccine effectiveness against emerging variants, persistence of vaccine-induced protection, surveillance of adverse event following immunization with large-scale vaccine use, and modelling studies on strategic combinations of vaccination and non-pharmacological interventions.

AB  - While humoral immune responses to infection or vaccination with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 have been well-characterized, responses elicited by infection with variants are less understood. Here we characterized the repertoire, epitope specificity, and cross-reactivity of antibodies elicited by Beta and Gamma variant infection compared to ancestral virus. We developed a high-throughput approach to obtain single-cell immunoglobulin sequences and isolate monoclonal antibodies for functional assessment. Spike-, RBD- and NTD-specific antibodies elicited by Beta- or Gamma-infection exhibited a remarkably similar hierarchy of epitope immunodominance for RBD and convergent V gene usage when compared to ancestral virus infection. Additionally, similar public B cell clones were elicited regardless of infecting variant. These convergent responses may account for the broad cross-reactivity and continued efficacy of vaccines based on a single ancestral variant.

AB  - In the two years since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started, it has caused over 5 million deaths and 400 million infected cases, and the world continues to be on high alert for COVID-19. Among the variants of interest and concern of SARS-CoV-2, the current Omicron (B.1.1.529) and stealth Omicron (BA.2) raised serious concerns due to rapid rates of infection caused by numerous mutations in the spike protein, which could escape from the antibody-mediated neutralization and increase the risk of reinfections. Hence, this work aims to describe the most relevant mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, discuss vaccine against variant of concerns, describe rare adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination, introduce the most available promising COVID-19 vaccine candidates, and provide few perspectives of the future variants.

AB  - Introduction: the emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants like Delta and Omicron have triggered the next wave of COVID-19 in many parts of the world. Here we report a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the Northwest (NW) Region of Cameroon, which is plagued with low immunization coverage and armed conflict. Method(s): a cross-sectional study was conducted in September 2021 and data on COVID-19 cases and vaccination were reviewed from the Ministry of Health database from January 1st, 2020 to September 4th, 2021. The security situation of the region was obtained from the districts and regional health managers. Data were analyzed with MS Excel and results presented as trends and proportions. Result(s): since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, there is an increasing prevalence in cases in the NW. Between epidemiological week 34-35 of 2021, there was a surge in COVID-19 cases in the NW. More than 70% of all COVID-19 related deaths reported in the country during epidemiological week-35 were recorded in this region. Despite this high mortality, COVID-19 vaccine uptake remains very low in the region. Indeed, just 0.6% of the 962,036-target population 18-years and above are fully immunized after 6-months of vaccination. Conclusion(s): though the country's epi-curve does not suggest a third wave currently, the NW is experiencing a steady COVID-19 case surge amid insecurity and the circulation of the Delta variant. There is therefore a need to adopt innovative strategies to improve immunization and strengthen other SARS-CoV-2 preventive measures in this region.Copyright © Andreas Ateke Njoh et al.

AB  - The COVID-19 vaccination campaigns were met with a varying level of vaccine hesitancy in Europe. We analyzed the potential relationships between COVID-19 vaccine coverage in different countries of the European Economic Area and rates of infection, hospitalizations, admissions to intensive care units (ICU), and deaths during the autumn 2021 SARS-CoV-2 wave (September-December). Significant negative correlations between infection rates and the percentage of fully vaccinated individuals were found during September, October, and November, but not December. The loss of this protective effect in December is likely due to the emergence of the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, better adapted to evade vaccine-induced humoral immunity. For every considered month, the negative linear associations between the vaccine coverage and mean number of hospitalizations (r= -0.61 to -0.88), the mean number of ICU admissions (r= -0.62 to -0.81), and death rate (r= -0.64 to -0.84) were observed. The results highlight that vaccines provided significant benefits during autumn 2021. The vaccination of unvaccinated individuals should remain the primary strategy to decrease the hospital overloads, severe consequences of COVID-19, and deaths.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 booster uptake remained poor among healthcare workers (HCW) despite evidence of improved immunity against Delta and Omicron variants. While most studies used a questionnaire to assess hesitancy, this study aimed to identify factors affecting booster hesitancy by examining actual vaccine uptake across time., METHOD: COVID-19 vaccination database records among HCW working at seven Singaporean public primary care clinics between January to December 2021 were extracted, with sex, profession, place of practice, vaccination type, and dates. Time to booster was calculated from the date of vaccination minus date of eligibility. Chi-square test was used to compare the relationship between first dose and booster hesitancy, Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were adopted to evaluate differences in cumulative booster uptake. Multivariate Cox regression was used to investigate predictors for timely booster vaccination. Vaccination rate was charted across time and corroborated with media releases pertaining to legislative changes., RESULTS: A total of 877 of 891 (98.9%) primary care HCW were fully vaccinated, 73.8% of eligible HCW had taken the booster. HCW were less booster hesitant [median 16 (5-31.3) days] compared to the first dose [median 39 (13-119.3) days]. First dose-hesitant HCW were more likely to be booster hesitant (OR = 3.66, 95%CI 2.61-5.14). Adjusting for sex, workplace, and time to first dose, ancillary (HR = 1.53, 95%CI 1.03-2.28), medical (HR = 1.8, 95%CI 1.18-2.74), and nursing (HR = 1.8, 95%CI 1.18-2.37) received boosters earlier compared with administrative staff. No temporal relationship was observed between booster uptake, legislative changes, and COVID-19 infection numbers., CONCLUSION: Vaccine hesitancy among HCW had improved from first dose to booster, with timely booster vaccination among medical and nursing staff. Tailored education, risk messaging, and strategic legislation might help to reduce delayed booster vaccination.

AB  - The BA.1 sub-lineage of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, first detected in the UK in mid-November 2021, rapidly became the dominant strain partly due to reduced vaccine effectiveness. An increase in a second Omicron sub-lineage BA.2 was observed in early January 2022. In this study we use a test-negative case control study design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease with BA.1 and BA.2 after one or two doses of BNT162b2, ChAdOx1-S or mRNA-1273, and after booster doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 during a period of co-circulation. Overall, there was no evidence that vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease is reduced following infection with the BA.2 sub-lineage as compared to BA.1. Furthermore, similar rates of waning were observed after the second and booster dose for each sub-lineage. These data provide reassuring evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines currently in use against symptomatic disease caused by BA.2.

AB  - 1,5 years into the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 remains a dynamic and evolving disease. Growing proportions of the population have been vaccinated, but what degree of protection does vaccination actually offer, particularly in the face of an evolving virus and the emergence of viral variants? Here we explore the limits of vaccine protection -providing an overview of emerging data on how well vaccines protect against mild and asymptomatic disease, vaccine effectiveness against the backdrop of variants such as the Delta, and the implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We assess the continued risks for our vulnerable elderly and immune-compromised patient populations, and whether emerging literature should impact our diagnostic strategies.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 still remains to be the cause of the Covid-19 pandemic, with more than 200 million infections and over 4.5 million deaths worldwide. With the onset of this pandemic, vaccine development efforts began on an unprecedented scale in the world, and it was seen that some vaccines received global application permissions in a very short period of time. For now, it has been proven that current COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in protecting against serious illness and death. However, there remains much to learn about the immune response of vaccines and the duration of protection, and how we can further optimize vaccines against new variants. As of today, some inactivated vaccines (eg. Sinovac, Sinopharm, BharatBiotech), mRNA vaccines (eg.Pfizer&Bionthec, Moderna), Non-Replicating Viral Vector ones (eg. Oxford, Astra- Zeneca, Sputnik V) and recombinant protein vaccines (eg.Novovax) have been approved for immediate use, but determining the longterm effectiveness of vaccination with existing vaccines and moving towards adolescent and pediatric applications, as well as the reports on some serious side effects seen especially with mRNA and vector vaccines, remain important issues. In addition, the difficulties of poor countries' access to vaccines, and serious vaccine insecurity or rejection in almost all countries constitute major obstacles against the termination of the pandemic. The extension of the time required for the formation of herd immunity leads to the emergence of new variants. The rapid spread of these variants leading to a significant decrease in the effectiveness of the existing vaccines brings about a need for the modification of the current vaccines. During this period, we developed a different vaccine candidate and two vaccine formulations that can be easily adapted to emerging variants. In our study, a fragment protein (P1; MW: 33 kDa) containing the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) in the spike S1 region, a fragment protein in the S2 region (P2; MW: 17.6) and nucleocapsid protein (N; MW: 46 kDa) were expressed in Escherichia coli, and subsequently the recombinant proteins were purified. It was determined that each of these three protein antigens reacted strongly with recovered Covid-19 patient sera. The combination of these three proteins was adsorbed with one adjuvant or two adjuvants led to the development of two formulations. In mouse immunization studies, these vaccine candidates elicited very high titers of anti-P1 IgG and IgG2a, anti-P2 IgG and IgG2a, and anti-N IgG and IgG2a. In the live virus neutralization assays, high virus neutralizing antibody levels were observed, and by obtaining specific interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) from immunized mouse splenocytes, we proved that a good cellular immunity was achieved too. These findings, overall, validated high immunogenicity of the P1 and P2 proteins of the S region and the N protein to order to develop an effective vaccine candidate against SARS CoV-2 infection. In addition, a variant recombinant protein was designed by our group and prepared in the same way. This protein that contains the most important point mutations of the known variants is being intended to be incorporated into our candidate vaccine. Our studies are being conducted in this direction and we aim at starting Phase I trials as soon as possible. In conclusion, such alterations/adaptations in vaccine formulations are highly important to optimize current vaccines. In order to reduce the worldwide effects of SARS-CoV-2 variants, it is necessary to develop new generation COVID-19 vaccines besides an urgent elimination of the vaccine inequality all over the world.

AB  - Mutations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can enhance the spread and the infectiousness and decrease the protective effect of antibodies present after infection, vaccination or antibody treatment. The alpha variant (B.1.1.7), first seen in Kent/United Kingdom, has increased the R-value and therefore the infectiousness by 75%; however, the effectiveness of the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 available in Germany seems to be only slightly impaired by these mutations. In the case of the beta variant (B.1.351), first described in South Africa, the neutralization ability of antibodies towards SARS-CoV-2 is decreased. The monoclonal antibodies bamlanivimab and etesivimab, which are used therapeutically, are ineffective. The AstraZeneca vaccine offers almost no protection against mild or moderate disease caused by the beta variant. The gamma variant (P.1 or B.1.1.28.1), which was first found in Brazil, is probably 1.7-2.6 times more transmissible than previous virus strains circulating in Brazil. In addition to the infectiousness, the mortality risk of the gamma variant also seems to be increased between 1.2 and 1.9-fold in adults and between 5 and 8-fold in young persons. The delta variant (B.1.617), first described in India, is now dominant in most countries. It is 50% more infectious than the alpha variant, and the protective effect of vaccinations against symptomatic disease can be decreased (Biontech: delta variant 88%, alpha variant 93.7%; AstraZeneca: delta variant 67%, alpha variant 74.5%). Furthermore, the course of the disease with the delta variant is often more severe than with the wild type. Disease courses with the delta variant are less severe in vaccinated than in nonvaccinated persons, and fatal outcomes are substantially rarer. A high vaccination rate is essential in order to approach herd immunity and to bring the pandemic under control. Even where the protective effect towards mild or moderate disease is decreased, as a rule, vaccination still offers excellent protection against life-threatening and fatal disease courses.

AB  - A vaccine is required to effectively control the COVID-19 pandemic in the mid and long term. The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 was initiated as soon as the genetic sequence of the virus was published, and has evolved at an unprecedented speed, with a first clinical trial launched in March 2020. One year later, more than a dozen of vaccines based on different concepts, with some having been evaluated only in clinical trials so far, are authorized under emergency procedures. Here, we review these vaccines, compare their properties and discuss the challenges they face, including the emergence of viral variants of concern. Copyright © 2021 medecine/sciences - Inserm.

AB  - The vast scale of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data has made it increasingly challenging to comprehensively analyze all available data using existing tools and file formats. To address this, we present a database of SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic trees inferred with unrestricted public sequences, which we update daily to incorporate new sequences. Our database uses the recently proposed mutation-annotated tree (MAT) format to efficiently encode the tree with branches labeled with parsimony-inferred mutations, as well as Nextstrain clade and Pango lineage labels at clade roots. As of June 9, 2021, our SARS-CoV-2 MAT consists of 834,521 sequences and provides a comprehensive view of the virus' evolutionary history using public data. We also present matUtils-a command-line utility for rapidly querying, interpreting, and manipulating the MATs. Our daily-updated SARS-CoV-2 MAT database and matUtils software are available at http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/wuhCor1/UShER_SARS-CoV-2/and https://github.com/yatisht/usher, respectively.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: Recent estimates indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, could be effectively controlled via the development and implementation of diagnostic tools such as quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). However, this reaction often generates false-negative results due to novel mutations and can also be affected by the secondary structure of the RNA transcripts that derive from the gene sequence used for diagnostic purposes. Methods: : Using high-performance computing, we consolidated a global SARS-CoV-2 genome repository encompassing 19,317 genomes from the GenBank database and 107,259 from the GISAID database to generate monthly SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences from January to December 2020. Results: : These sequences were then used to create ORF8 -specific primers and probes to validate single and multiplex RT-qPCR protocols both in silico and experimentally using genes E (Berlin protocol) and N (CDC protocol) as targets. Conclusions: : Our findings demonstrated that RT-qPCR Ct values were improved by the inclusion of either a denaturing solution composed of tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and by adjusting nucleotide proportions based on the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

AB  - In Dec 2021-Feb 2022, an intense and unprecedented co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants with high genetic diversity raised the question of possible co-infections between variants and how to detect them. Using 11 mixes of Delta:Omicron isolates at different ratios, we evaluated the performance of 4 different sets of primers used for whole-genome sequencing and we developed an unbiased bioinformatics method which can detect all co-infections irrespective of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages involved. Applied on 21,387 samples collected between weeks 49-2021 and 08-2022 from random genomic surveillance in France, we detected 53 co-infections between different lineages. The prevalence of Delta and Omicron (BA.1) co-infections and Omicron lineages BA.1 and BA.2 co-infections were estimated at 0.18% and 0.26%, respectively. Among 6,242 hospitalized patients, the intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates were 1.64%, 4.81% and 15.38% in Omicron, Delta and Delta/Omicron patients, respectively. No BA.1/BA.2 co-infections were reported among ICU admitted patients. Although SARS-CoV-2 co-infections were rare in this study, their proper detection is crucial to evaluate their clinical impact and the risk of the emergence of potential recombinants.

AB  - Owing to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) worldwide at the end of 2019, the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine became an urgent need. In this study, we developed a type 9 adeno-associated virus vectored vaccine candidate expressing a dimeric receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) and evaluated its immunogenicity in a murine model. The vaccine candidate, named AAV9-RBD virus, was constructed by inserting a signal peptide to the N-terminus of two copies of RBD, spaced by a linker, into the genome of a type 9 adeno-associated virus. In vitro assays showed that HeLa cells infected by the recombinant AAV virus expressed high levels of the recombinant RBD protein, mostly found in the cell culture supernatant. The recombinant AAV9-RBD virus was cultured and purified. The genome titer of the purified recombinant AAV9-RBD virus was determined to be 2.4 x 1013 genome copies/mL (GC/mL) by Q-PCR. Balb/c mice were immunized with the virus by intramuscular injection or nasal drip administration. Eight weeks after immunization, neutralizing antibodies against the new coronavirus pseudovirus were detected in the sera of all mice; the mean neutralizing antibody EC50 values were 517.7 +/- 292.1 (n=10) and 682.8 +/- 454.0 (n=10) in the intramuscular injection group and nasal drip group, respectively. The results of this study showed that the recombinant AAV9-RBD virus may be used for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.Copyright © 2022 Qin, Li, Li, Pei, Liu, Ding, Liu, Bi, Shi, Guo, Fang, Huang, Yu, Zhu, An, Valencia, Li, Dong and Zhou.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant is spreading rapidly, even in vaccinated individuals, raising concerns about immune escape. Here, we studied neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses targeting SARS-CoV-2 D614G [wild type (WT)] and the Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants of concern in a cohort of 60 health care workers after immunization with ChAdOx-1 S, Ad26.COV2.S, mRNA-1273, or BNT162b2. High binding antibody levels against WT SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) were detected 28 days after vaccination with both mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2), which substantially decreased after 6 months. In contrast, antibody levels were lower after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination but did not wane. Neutralization assays showed consistent cross-neutralization of the Beta and Delta variants, but neutralization of Omicron was significantly lower or absent. BNT162b2 booster vaccination after either two mRNA-1273 immunizations or Ad26.COV2 priming partially restored neutralization of the Omicron variant, but responses were still up to 17-fold decreased compared with WT. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detected up to 6 months after all vaccination regimens, with more consistent detection of specific CD4+ than CD8+ T cells. No significant differences were detected between WT- and variant-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cell responses, including Omicron, indicating minimal escape at the T cell level. This study shows that vaccinated individuals retain T cell immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, potentially balancing the lack of neutralizing antibodies in preventing or limiting severe COVID-19. Booster vaccinations are needed to further restore Omicron cross-neutralization by antibodies.

AB  - Despite the remarkable efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, waning immunity, and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants such as Omicron represents a major global health challenge. Here we present data from a study in non-human primates demonstrating durable protection against the Omicron BA.1 variant induced by a subunit SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, consisting of RBD (receptor binding domain) on the I53-50 nanoparticle, adjuvanted with AS03, currently in Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT05007951). Vaccination induced robust neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers that were maintained at high levels for at least one year after two doses (Pseudovirus nAb GMT: 2207, Live-virus nAb GMT: 1964) against the ancestral strain, but not against Omicron. However, a booster dose at 6-12 months with RBD-Wu or RBD-{beta} (RBD from the Beta variant) displayed on I53-50 elicited equivalent and remarkably high neutralizing titers against the ancestral as well as the Omicron variant. Furthermore, there were substantial and persistent memory T and B cell responses reactive to Beta and Omicron variants. Importantly, vaccination resulted in protection against Omicron infection in the lung (no detectable virus in any animal) and profound suppression of viral burden in the nares (median peak viral load of 7567 as opposed to 1.3x107 copies in unvaccinated animals) at 6 weeks post final booster. Even at 6 months post vaccination, there was significant protection in the lung (with 7 out of 11 animals showing no viral load, 3 out of 11 animals showing ~20-fold lower viral load than unvaccinated controls) and rapid control of virus in the nares. These results highlight the durable cross-protective immunity elicited by the AS03-adjuvanted RBD-I53-50 nanoparticle vaccine platform.

AB  - BackgroundLong-term care facilities (LTCF) have been prioritised for vaccination, but data on potential waning of vaccine effectiveness (VE) and the impact of booster doses in this vulnerable population remains scarce. MethodsWe included residents and staff from 331 LTCFs enrolled in VIVALDI (ISRCTN 14447421), who underwent routine PCR testing between Dec 8, 2020 - Dec 11, 2021 in a Cox proportional hazards regression, estimating VE against SARS-CoV2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and COVID-19-related death after 1-3 vaccine doses, stratifying by previous SARS-CoV2 exposure. ResultsFor 15,518 older residents, VE declined from 50{middle dot}7% (15{middle dot}5, 71{middle dot}3) to 17{middle dot}2% ([~]23{middle dot}9, 44{middle dot}6) against infection; from 85{middle dot}4% (60{middle dot}7, 94{middle dot}.6) to 54{middle dot}3% (26{middle dot}2, 71{middle dot}7) against hospitalisation; and from 94{middle dot}4% (76{middle dot}4, 98{middle dot}7) to 62{middle dot}8% (32{middle dot}9, 79{middle dot}4) against death, when comparing 2-12 weeks and [≥]12 weeks after two doses. For 19,515 staff, VE against infection declined slightly from 50{middle dot}3% (32{middle dot}7, 63{middle dot}3) to 42{middle dot}1% 29{middle dot}5, 52{middle dot}4). High VE was restored following a third dose, with VE of 71{middle dot}6% (53{middle dot}5, 82{middle dot}7) and 78{middle dot}3% (70{middle dot}1, 84{middle dot}3) against infection and 89{middle dot}9% (80{middle dot}0, 94{middle dot}6) and 95{middle dot}8% (50{middle dot}4, 99{middle dot}6) against hospitalisation, for residents and staff respectively; and 97{middle dot}5% (88{middle dot}1, 99{middle dot}5) against death for residents. InterpretationSubstantial waning of VE is observed against all outcomes in residents from 12 weeks after a primary course of AstraZeneca or mRNA vaccines. Boosters restore protection, and maximise immunity across all outcomes. These findings demonstrate the importance of boosting and the need for ongoing surveillance of VE in this vulnerable cohort. FundingUK Government Department of Health and Social Care. Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched MEDLINE and medRxiv for studies reporting vaccine effectiveness (VE) over time after two or three doses against SARS-CoV2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, or COVID-19-related death amongst staff or residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs), that were published between Jan 1, 2020, and December 21, 2021. We used variations of the search terms "COVID-19" OR "SARS-CoV-2" AND "vaccine effectiveness" OR "vaccine efficacy" AND "care homes" OR "long term care facilities". We identified 8 articles reporting two-dose data from LTCFs, including 1 peer-reviewed paper from Israel, 1 preprint from Denmark, 1 preprint from Norway, 1 peer-reviewed paper from France, two peer-reviewed papers from Spain, 1 peer-reviewed paper from the USA, and 1 preprint from England; however none of these studies examined waning of protection over time after two doses. Five studies (mRNA vaccines 3-4 weeks interval) reported short-term two-dose VE of 49-71% in residents, and 82-90% in staff. Two-dose VE was reported to be 75-88% against hospitalisation, 87-97% against death, and 86% against either outcome. An English study of residents (Pfizer or AstraZeneca, 8-12 week interval) reported 73% VE against infection and noted VE waning from 7 weeks after the first dose, but did not examine waning after the second dose. All of these studies were set prior to emergence of the Delta variant and did not examine waning of immunity due to short lengths of follow-up after Dose 2. Only one study (USA) compared Pfizer/Moderna two-dose VE against infection in LTCF residents before (67{middle dot}5% [60{middle dot}1-73{middle dot}5%]) and during (53{middle dot}1% [49{middle dot}1-56{middle dot}7%]) Delta variant predominance; however, authors could not access vaccination dates therefore did not account for any waning of immunity over time; they also did not examine any severe clinical o tcomes. We identified only one correspondence piece from Israel (Pfizer 3-4 week interval) describing the benefit of a third booster dose in LTCFs; it reported relative rate reductions of 71% for infection and 80%, for hospitalisation in the period after booster roll-out. However, individual-level VE estimates by time since vaccination were not reported, and adjustment for prior infection was not undertaken. Overall, there was a paucity of data on non-mRNA vaccines, waning of immunity over time after two doses, and VE following a third (booster) dose in LTCF populations, which we address in this study. Added value of this studyWe report findings from a prospective cohort study that includes 15,518 residents and 19,515 staff from 331 LTCFs across England, who underwent routine PCR testing 2-3 times per month, looking at SARS-CoV2 vaccine effectiveness over 12 months (Dec 8, 2020-Dec 11, 2021), which is the longest duration of follow-up of any study within this vulnerable cohort. We evaluated the effectiveness of first, second, and booster vaccine doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna against infection, hospitalisation, and death over the 12 months when the Alpha and Delta variants were dominant. Our findings affirm that complete vaccination with two doses of AstraZeneca or mRNA vaccines offers moderate protection against infection, and high protection against severe clinical outcomes, however this protection declines over time, particularly for residents. A third booster dose of an mRNA vaccine restores, and indeed maximises, VE to 71{middle dot}6% (53{middle dot}5, 82{middle dot}7) and 78{middle dot}3% (70{middle dot}1, 84{middle dot}3) against infection, and 89{middle dot}9% (80{middle dot}0, 94{middle dot}6) and 95{middle dot}8% (50{middle dot}4, 99{middle dot}6) against hospitalisation, for residents and staff respectively, and to 97{middle dot}5% (88{middle dot}1, 99{middle dot}5) against death for residents, with similar protection offered after the third dose irrespective of primary course type. This is the first study to examine and describe waning of immunity over a one-year period, as well as vaccine effectiveness of a booster dose, in a large cohort of LTCF staff and residents. Implications of all the available evidenceTaken together, our findings indicate high short-term immunity against SARS-CoV2 infection and very high immunity against severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 for LTCF residents and staff following vaccination. However substantial waning in vaccine-derived immunity is seen beyond 3 months, irrespective of vaccine type, suggesting the need for regular boosting to maintain protection in this vulnerable cohort. Although this analysis took place in the pre-Omicron period, these trends of waning immunity over time are likely to be generalisable across variants, carrying important implications for long-term vaccination policy in LTCFs. Ongoing surveillance in this vulnerable cohort remains crucial, in order to describe further changes in vaccine-induced immunity, particularly in the context of new variants.

AB  - Background. Indonesia is one of the Southeast Asian countries with high case numbers of COVID-19 with up to 4.2 million confirmed cases by 29 October 2021. Understanding the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for delivering public health intervention as certain variants may have different attributes that can potentially affect their transmissibility, as well as the performance of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. Objectives. We aimed to investigate the dynamics of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants over a 15-month period in Bogor and its surrounding areas in correlation with the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Indonesia. Methods. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples collected from suspected patients from Bogor, Jakarta and Tangerang were confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR. RNA samples of those confirmed patients were subjected to whole genome sequencing using the ARTIC Network protocol and sequencer platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Results. We successfully identified 16 lineages and six clades out of 202 samples (male nD116, female nD86). Genome analysis revealed that Indonesian lineage B.1.466.2 dominated during the first wave (nD48, 23.8%) while Delta variants (AY.23, AY.24, AY.39, AY.42, AY.43 dan AY.79) were dominant during the second wave (n D 53, 26.2%) following the highest number of confirmed cases in Indonesia. In the spike protein gene, S_D614G and S_P681R changes were dominant in both B.1.466.2 and Delta variants, while N439K was only observed in B.1.466.2 (nD44) and B.1.470 (nD 1). Additionally, the S_T19R, S_E156G, S_F157del, S_R158del, S_L452R, S_T478K, S_D950N and S_V1264L changes were only detected in Delta variants, consistent with those changes being characteristic of Delta variants in general. Conclusions. We demonstrated a shift in SARS-CoV-2 variants from the first wave of COVID-19 to Delta variants in the second wave, during which the number of confirmed cases surpassed those in the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Higher proportion of unique mutations detected in Delta variants compared to the first wave variants indicated potential mutational effects on viral transmissibility that correlated with a higher incidence of confirmed cases. Genomic surveillance of circulating variants, especially those with higher transmissibility, should be continuously conducted to rapidly inform decision making and support outbreak preparedness, prevention, and public health response.Copyright © 2022 Prasetyoputri et al.

AB  - Vaccines are the most important means to overcome the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. They induce specific antibody and T-cell responses but it remains open how well vaccine-induced immunity is preserved over time following homologous and heterologous immunization regimens. Here, we compared the dynamics of humoral and cellular immune responses up to 5 months after homologous or heterologous vaccination with either ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 (ChAd) or BNT162b2 (BNT) or both. Antibody responses significantly waned after vaccination, irrespective of the regimen. The capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 - including variants of concern such as Delta or Omicron - was superior after heterologous compared to homologous BNT vaccination, both of which resulted in longer-lasting humoral immunity than homologous ChAd immunization. T-cell responses showed less waning irrespective of the vaccination regimen. These findings demonstrate that heterologous vaccination with ChAd and BNT is a potent approach to induce long-term humoral and cellular immune protection. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSDue to some rare severe side effects after the administration of the adenoviral vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, many countries recommended a heterologous vaccination scheme including mRNA vaccines like BNT162b2 for the second dose. We performed a PubMed search (with no restrictions on time span) using the search terms "SARS-CoV-2" and "heterologous vaccination" and obtained 247 results. Only a fraction of manuscripts included direct comparisons of patient cohorts that received either a heterologous or a homologous vaccination regimen. Of those, the vast majority investigated only short-term immunogenicity after vaccination. Thus, little is known about the long-term maintenance of immunity by heterologous compared to homologous vaccination. Added value of this studyWe add a very comprehensive and comparative study investigating heterologous and homologous vaccination regimens early and late after vaccination. Key features include the number of patients (n = 473), the number of vaccination cohorts (n= 3), the fact that samples were derived from three independent study centers and comparative analyses were performed at two independent study centers, as well as in-depth investigation of humoral and T cellular immunity. Implications of all the available evidenceThe recent data creates a line of evidence that heterologous vaccination, compared to homologous vaccination regimens, results in at least non-inferior maintenance of humoral and cellular immunity. The enhanced understanding of immunity induced by individual vaccination regimens is crucial for further recommendations regarding the necessity, timing and choice of additional vaccinations and public health policies.

AB  - BACKGROUNDProtection offered by five different forms of immunity, combining natural and vaccine immunity, was investigated against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron symptomatic BA.1 infection, symptomatic BA.2 infection, BA.1 hospitalization and death, and BA.2 hospitalization and death, in Qatar, between December 23, 2021 and February 21, 2022. METHODSSix national, matched, test-negative case-control studies were conducted to estimate effectiveness of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine, natural immunity due to prior infection with pre-Omicron variants, and hybrid immunity from prior infection and vaccination. RESULTSEffectiveness of only prior infection against symptomatic BA.2 infection was 46.1% (95% CI: 39.5-51.9%). Effectiveness of only two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was negligible at -1.1% (95% CI: -7.1-4.6), but nearly all individuals had received their second dose several months earlier. Effectiveness of only three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 52.2% (95% CI: 48.1-55.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 55.1% (95% CI: 50.9-58.9%). Effectiveness of hybrid immunity of prior infection and three-dose BNT162b2 vaccination was 77.3% (95% CI: 72.4-81.4%). Meanwhile, prior infection, BNT162b2 vaccination, and hybrid immunity all showed strong effectiveness >70% against any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 due to BA.2 infection. Similar levels and patterns of effectiveness were observed for BA.1 and for the mRNA-1273 vaccine. CONCLUSIONSThere are no discernable differences in the effects of prior infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity against BA.1 versus BA.2. Hybrid immunity resulting from prior infection and recent booster vaccination confers the strongest protection against either subvariant. Vaccination enhances protection of those with a prior infection.

AB  - Although numerous COVID-19 vaccines are effective against COVID-19 infection and variants of concern (VOC) in the real world, it is imperative to obtain evidence of the corresponding vaccine effectiveness (VE). This study estimates the real-world effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines against COVID-19 infection and determines the influence of different virus variants on VE by using test-negative design (TND) studies. We systematically searched for published articles on the efficacy of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 against COVID-19 infection. Two researchers independently selected and extracted data from eligible studies. We calculated the VE associated with different vaccine types, SARS-CoV-2 variants, and vaccination statuses, using an inverse variance random-effects model. We selected 19 eligible studies in the meta-analysis from 1651 records. For the partially vaccinated group, the VE of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 was 61% and 78% against COVID-19 infection, respectively. For the completely vaccinated group, the VE of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 was 90% and 92% against COVID-19 infection, respectively. During subgroup analyses, the overall VE of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 against the Delta variant was 53% and 71%, respectively, for the partially vaccinated group; the respective VE values were 85% and 91% for the fully vaccinated group. Irrespective of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines, the Delta variant significantly weakened vaccine protection for the partially vaccinated group, while full vaccination was highly effective against COVID-19 infection and various VOC. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is more effective against COVID-19 infection and VOC than the BNT162b2 vaccine, especially for the partially vaccinated group. Overall, the results provide recommendations for national and regional vaccine policies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) for Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1) and CoronaVac against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers (HCWs)., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among HCWs (aged >=18 years) working in a private healthcare system in Brazil between January 1, 2021 and August 3, 2021. To assess VE, we calculated VE=1-RR (rate ratio), with RR determined by adjusting Poisson models with the occurrence of COVID-19 infection as the outcome, and the vaccination status as the main exploratory variable. We used the logarithmic link function and simple models adjusting for sex, age and job types., RESULTS: 13,813 HCWs met the inclusion criteria for this analysis. 6,385 (46.2%) received the CoronaVacvaccine, 5,916 (42.8%) received the ChAdOx1 vaccine, and 1,512 (11.0%) were not vaccinated. Overall, COVID-19 infection cases happened in 6% of unvaccinated HCWs, 3% of HCWs receiving two doses of CoronaVacvaccine, and 0.7% of HCWs receiving two doses of ChAdOx1 vaccine (p-value< 0.001). In the adjusted analyses, the estimated VE was 51.3% for CoronaVac, and 88.1% for ChAdOx1 vaccine. Both vaccines reduced the number of hospitalizations, the length of hospital stay, and the need of mechanical ventilation. Nineteen SARSCoV-2 samples from nineteen HCWs were screened for mutations of interest. Eighteen out of nineteen of those samples were Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variant., CONCLUSIONS: While both COVID-19 vaccines (viral vector and inactivated virus) can significantly prevent COVID-19 infection among HCWs, CoronaVac was much less effective. The COVID-19 vaccines were also effective even against a dominant Gamma variant.

AB  - There is a growing interest in using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the early stages of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to prevent disease progression. Little is known about the efficacy of mAbs against the delta variant of concern and its clinical presentations. We evaluated the effect of casirivimab/imdevimab treatment among five delta vaccine breakthrough patients. Symptomatic non-hospitalized vaccinated patients were submitted to nasopharyngeal swabs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Blood analysis and chest Computed Tomography were also performed. A cocktail of casirivimab/imdevimab was administrated, and patients were monitored weekly. Clinical evolution was evaluated by the regression of the symptoms, negative results by real-time RT-PCR, and by the need of hospitalization: these aspects were considered as significant outcomes. In four cases, symptom reversion and viral load reduction were observed within 2 days and 7 days after mAbs treatment, respectively. Only one case, suffering from thymoma, was hospitalized 2 days later because of respiratory failure, which reverted within 18 days. mAbs treatment seems to be safe and effective against the delta variant and its clinical manifestations.

AB  - Background: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients (pts) with thoracic malignancies is crucial since they are at high risk of having severe COVID-19 disease course. Still, data on efficacy of vaccination in this pt population are scarce. Method(s): Prospective observational study of pts with solid cancers on active anticancer treatment (chemotherapy, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) or targeted therapy (TT)) that received mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was performed. Pts were sampled before, 2-3 weeks after the first, 2-3 weeks after the second dose, 3 and 6 months after the complete primary course of vaccination. Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibodies in serum was determined with commercial ELISA assay IDK. Samples with >= 175 ng/ml were considered positive. Here we present data on pts with thoracic malignancies. Result(s): Ninety-two pts were included in the analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years, 49% were female and 93% were currently receiving anticancer therapy. Pts were treated for NSCLC, SCLC and malignant pleural mesothelioma in 90%, 5% and 5%, respectively. Eighteen pts had previous exposure to COVID-19. Out of 74 COVID-19 naive pts, seroconversion after 1st vaccination was 61%, after 2nd 96%, and seropositivity 3 and 6 months after 2nd vaccination 94% and 95%, respectively. According to treatment type, pts treated with chemotherapy, chemo + ICI, ICI alone or TT achieved seroconversion after 2nd vaccination in 100%, 83%, 96% and 100%, and mostly maintained positive levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibodies 6 months after 2nd vaccination with 100%, 100%, 89% and 95%, respectively. However, there was a marked decrease in anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibody level of 69% in average 3 months after and 80% in average 6 months after the 2nd vaccination in pts with thoracic malignancies (both P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Pts with thoracic malignancies achieve high proportion of seroconversion after two doses of mRNA-based vaccines, yet, anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibody levels decline substantially 3 and 6 months after the 2nd vaccination, thus the 3rd dose of vaccine is reasonable to provide adequate protection against severe COVID-19 disease course.

AB  - BackgroundNanocovax is a recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 subunit vaccine composed of full-length prefusion stabilized recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (S-2P) and aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. In a Phase 1 and 2 studies, (NCT04683484) the vaccine was found to be safe and induce a robust immune response in healthy adult participants. MethodsWe conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of the Nanocovax vaccine against Covid-19 in approximately 13,007 volunteers aged 18 years and over. The immunogenicity was assessed based on Anti-S IgG antibody response, surrogate virus neutralization, wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and the types of helper T-cell response by intracellular staining (ICS) for interferon gamma (IFNg) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). The vaccine efficacy (VE) was calculated basing on serologically confirmed cases of Covid-19. FindingsUp to day 180, incidences of solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AE) were similar between vaccine and placebo groups. 100 serious adverse events (SAE) were observed in both vaccine and placebo groups (out of total 13007 participants). 96 out of these 100 SAEs were determined to be unrelated to the investigational products. 4 SAEs were possibly related, as determined by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and investigators. Reactogenicity was absent or mild in the majority of participants and of short duration. These findings highlight the excellent safety profile of Nanocovax. Regarding immunogenicity, Nanocovax induced robust IgG and neutralizing antibody responses. Importantly, Anti S-IgG levels and neutralizing antibody titers on day 42 were higher than those of natural infected cases. Nanocovax was found to induce Th2 polarization rather than Th1. Post-hoc analysis showed that the VE against symptomatic disease was 51.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] was [34.4%-64.1%]. VE against severe illness and death were 93.3% [62.2-98.1]. Notably, the dominant strain during the period of this study was Delta variant. InterpretationNanocovax 25 microgram (mcg) was found to be safe with the efficacy against symptomatic infection of Delta variant of 51.5%. FundingResearch was funded by Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology JSC., and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Vietnam; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04922788.

AB  - Background: As the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the cause of COVID-19, emerged in early 2020 and quickly spread across the globe, clinical molecular genetics laboratories experienced a dramatic drop in samples referred for clinical testing as non-critical healthcare appointments were postponed. These laboratories, utilizing years of expertise in a field of rapidly evolving new technologies and high throughput testing, as well as clinical technologists trained in high-complexity testing, large genetics laboratories stepped in the fill the gap, a measure that kept laboratories running and staff employed. Case presentation: Our expertise in high-throughput high-complexity led from requests to perform testing in our genomics laboratory to building new laboratories in both the United Sates (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). These efforts resulted in building three laboratories from an empty space to a functioning, staffed clinical laboratory in approximately eight weeks. In total, these laboratories have employed over 1200 individuals (~550 US and ~700 UK). To date, these laboratories have performed over 10 million SARS-CoV-2 assays. Initial challenges included navigating state, federal, and country regulations and rapidly training a large clinical staff while ensuring optimal assay performance. As the pandemic continued, unpredictable decreases and surges in case numbers led to uncertainty in program longevity and staffing needs creating operational challenges. Clinical testing in the US is governed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), which provide very specific requirements for personnel, training, proficiency testing and the quality management system. However, high complexity molecular testing for a viral target could fall into the CLIA category of general chemistry (as does molecular genetic testing) or microbiology, subcategory virology. The category chosen has dramatic effects on the specific experience required for technologists, supervisors and the laboratory director. Outside the US, laboratory requirements are dictated by accepted best practices and accrediting agencies, rather than specific laws, sometimes making it difficult to know what requirements need to be met. In the US, regulatory guidance has been dynamic. At the beginning of the pandemic, laboratories were required to use an assay with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or submit an EUA for their Laboratory Developed Test (EUA). In the fall of 2020, the FDA stopped requiring and declined to review new EUA applications for LDT assays. In November 2021 EUA submissions once again were required for any assay in use without an EUA. This has put unpresented pressure on laboratory operations to identify and hire qualified individuals to navigate the assay validation and subsequent assay management requirements. The FDA has approved EUAs with a wide range of assay sensitivity, ranging from 20 copies/ ml to several thousand copies/ ml. This wide range of assays used by the laboratories led to some unexpected outcomes. For example, individuals who tested positive the laboratory tested negative by another less sensitive assay, resulting in the perception of discrepant results. Further, vaccinated people testing positive, albeit with indication of a low viral load, was also unexpected. The high sensitivity of the assay with lowest copy detection allows the diagnosis of more individuals than less sensitivity assays, which is critical in stopping the spread of a virus that can be asymptomatic. An approach for cost saving is pooling of samples. When case numbers surge, as occurred with the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, a pooling approach is no longer efficient, therefore, a permanent shift to a pooling approach is not feasible. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, our experience with high-throughput sequencing is allowing us to pivot quickly to viral genome sequencing, which is proving critical to understanding and combating this pandemic. Rare metabolic diseases, intellectual disabilities and hereditary cancer syndro es will always still need attention and continuous innovation but the innovation in genomics has greatly facilitated the much needed scaling of testing facilities for SARS-CoV2. We will need to learn to balance these activities and continue to support testing needs for these in addition to emerging diseases.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Introduction: DNA biobanks developed for COVID-19 research have the potential to discover medically actionable findings that may be relevant not only for identifying individuals at high risk for COVID-19 related disease, but that also predict genetic conditions for which prevention, treatment or management strategies may be available. The GENCOV study was designed as a prospective, observational cohort study conducted among adult COVID-19 patients in Toronto and aims to identify the relationship between host genetic differences, immune response and severity of disease. Genome sequencing results are returned to ostensibly healthy participants and health outcomes are being evaluated. Participants have the opportunity to choose which information they would like returned by way of genetic counselling and a decision aid, including information on genetic conditions from the following categories: clinically actionable, carrier screening, rare genetic and untreatable disease, common disease risk and drug response. Advances in genomic research have created an opportunity for scientific researchers to study genetic contributions to disease and has afforded the right of participants to freely share in the potential benefits of these scientific advancements. In keeping with the moral and material interests of participants and the 'duty to contact', the GENCOV study returns information that may impact health. Here we report on medically actionable information identified from participants of the GENCOV study. Method(s): Of 1195 participants enrolled into GENCOV to date, 860 genomes have been sequenced and 136 genomes analyzed for return of genomic results. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants as classified by one or more reputable laboratories from ClinVar and assessed using the ACMG criteria for the interpretation of sequence variation were identified from whole genome data. Here we present data from variants that were identified in two gene panels, one comprised of 73 genes from the ACMG secondary findings v.3.0 panel "clinically actionable" list and the other a custom 920 carrier screening gene panel designed for reproductive planning, developed using several databases and resources (Clinical Genomic Database (CGD), ClinGen, OMIM, CSER. The total number of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were tabulated for each panel and per individual. In addition, the total copy number variants (CNVs) were tabulated and evaluated for pathogenic variants in either the 73 ACMG genes or for a deleted region anywhere in the genome encompassing genes with a known disease-gene relationship. The CNVs were detected using a combination of CNVnator, ERDS, and Manta for structural variant calls. Deletions were reported if they were greater than 10kb, occurred within exonic regions from OMIM morbid genes, CNVs were removed if greater than 1% frequency in DGV or MSSNG databases. Result(s): In total, 1334 variants were identified with a likely pathogenic or pathogenic classification in 136 genomes (CNVs excluded); 700 were observed once and 634 had two or more observations. 379 were confirmed as pathogenic; the remaining 955 (71.6%) variants were false positives. One-hundred and sixty-seven variants (120 unique) were identified in the carrier screening panel in 76 genes, all were heterozygous. Twenty-eight variants (19 unique) were in the ACMG panel in 8 genes, all in the heterozygote state, 22 in genes with autosomal recessive inheritance (AR), 4 in 3 genes with autosomal dominant inheritance (AD) and 3 in 2 genes were associated with both AR and or AD inheritance (one variant overlaps). Nineteen variants overlapped with both panels. Two-hundred and three variants fell into rare genetic disease panels other than ACMG or carrier screening. A total of 125 of 136 (91.9%) individuals had a pathogenic variant (excluding CNVs). There were 11 individuals in the cohort who had no variants identified, 25 individuals who had 1 likely pathogenic or pathogenic variant, 37 individuals with 2 variants, 23 individuals with 3 variants, 19 individuals with 4 variants, 6 individuals with 5 variants, 9 individuals with 6 variants, 2 individuals with 7 variants, 1 individual with 8 variants, 2 individuals with 9 variants and 1 individual with 11 variants. There were no clinically significant CNV calls that were identified in the ACMG genes in this cohort. There were 36 putative pathogenic CNVs greater than 10kb identified in autosomal recessive genes. Twenty-five out of 136 (18.4%) individuals had one or more deletions. One pathogenic deletion was identified in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in a carrier female and associated with X-linked recessive inheritance and having implications for reproductive planning. Four individuals (2.9%) had a clinically actionable pathogenic variant in an AD inherited ACMG panel gene. One was identified in a hereditary cancer gene for Lynch Syndrome with clinical management and at-risk testing recommendations for other family members. One was identified in the ENG gene responsible for AD hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, a vascular dysplasia leading to telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations for which there are treatments available. Two individuals had a reduced-penetrance APC variant (p.Ile1307Lys) associated familial adenomatous polyposis. Exclusion of these variants results in a clinically actionable dominant disease frequency of 1.5%. The most common known pathogenic ACMG panel variant was c.1270G>C (p.Asp424His) in the BTD gene associated with AR biotinidase deficiency, identified in 9 heterozygotes. The most common known pathogenic variant in our carrier screening panel was the AR variant c.-21G>A in the RBM8A gene in 9 heterozygotes and associated with TAR syndrome. Ten variants were also observed in CYP21A2, nine had the c.754G>T variant in the heterozygous state; this variant is associated with adrenal hyperplasia. Conclusion(s): This study reports the number and frequency of pathogenic variants identified in clinically actionable or carrier status genes from an ostensibly healthy population of 136 individuals receiving results back as part of the GENCOV study. Future analysis of data from 1195 individuals will estimate the frequency of pathogenic variation in various gene panels. As genome sequencing becomes common place for population-based screening or diagnostic programs, this work will provide valuable insight into what types of medically actionable genetic results may be identified and what implications they may have for individuals and families. Knowing whether or not this information will lead to clinical benefit will help inform health programs on the utility of genome technology for personalized medicine.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Introduction: Emerging infectious organisms, such as SARS-CoV-2, create public health crises that demand real-time tracking and ongoing surveillance of new variants to monitor changes in transmissibility, virulence, and effectiveness of vaccines. Aegis Sciences BioPharma Laboratory has sequenced over 250,000 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens from patients across the United States and Puerto Rico and evaluated the emergence, community spread, and dominance of variants of concern (VOC) in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Method(s): Through a collaboration with Walgreens, Aegis Sciences BioPharma Laboratory performs COVID-19 testing on patient specimens from all over the United States. Patients schedule appointments via an online portal, submit health data and vaccination status for physician review, and perform socially-distanced, self-collections from the Walgreens pharmacy drive-through while being observed by a trained clinical team member. SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens with an average cycle threshold (Ct) value of <30 were selected for sequencing based on their state's testing volume and overall population statistics. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and lineage analysis was performed via an optimized workflow using the Illumina COVIDSeq RUO Kits with the NovaSeq 6000 sequencer and the Illumina DRAGEN COVID Lineage Application. The prevalence and spread of variants of concern was evaluated in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Result(s): Since March 2021, Aegis has submitted over 250,000 sequences from COVID-19 positive patient specimens to the GISAID database, including 437 unique SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Starting in May, the patient's vaccination status was captured to help monitor vaccine effectiveness and compare variant spread in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals. In total, 170,019 patient specimens with a vaccination status have been sequenced. From March to May 2021, Alpha (B.1.1.7) cases increased from 8% to 66%. At Alpha's peak (May to Mid-June), the average rate of breakthrough cases neared 10% of total sequenced samples. In early June, Delta (B.617.2) cases accounted for only 3% of samples but quickly rose to 60% while Alpha declined from 38% to 6%. From July to November 2021, Delta and its sub-lineages (AY) have dominated and accounted for >90% of all cases with an average breakthrough rate of ~30% overall. In early August, Delta's AY sublineages emerged and have since become more prevalent than their B.617.2 parent lineage. Of note, AY.25 (33.54%), AY.44 (37.69%), and AY.39 (36.79%) also have increased vaccine breakthrough rates with the highest breakthrough rate in AY.103 (41.36%). Conclusion(s): Monitoring viral variant trends and epidemiology through community surveillance programs is critical during a public health crisis. The data generated through these collaborations is vital to tracking viral evolution and understanding changes in transmissibility, virulence, and vaccine effectiveness. Aegis' sequencing and analysis of >250,000 SARS CoV-2 specimens will continue to contribute to our understanding of COVID-19 for years to come.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to major socio-economic disruption worldwide and the pandemic has yet to secede after more than 18 months. As of November 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 251 million people and caused over 5 million deaths worldwide. The discovery of aggressive variants of the virus has shown that monitoring for variants associated with changes to infection outcome and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to ensure the success of vaccination programs and establish robust public health responses. A sample identified positive for COVID-19 using an RT-PCR assay, then that sample can be tested to determine if it has a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC). Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is ideal for this as its high resolution enables scientists to identify all variants, known and unknown, providing insights to SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution. Method(s): Our laboratory is one of the largest COVID testing laboratories set up at apex largest outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 patients California state had seen since the beginning of the pandemic. The laboratory was set up in a total of 8 weeks which included reagent supply, staff, and operate a high-throughput, large scale SARS-CoV-2 testing facility which is capable of processing 150 thousand samples per day. To date, our laboratory has tested over 6 million patient samples for COVID-19 since its inception in November 2020 with a total positivity rate of 8.07% at this reporting. Due to the labs' ability to process SARS-CoV-2 patient samples at such a high-throughput with a turnaround time averaging 12.2 hours per sample, we quickly utilized our ability to rapidly mobilize the lab's skilled scientists to efficiently implement NGS at the lab. We exercised the collaborative efforts of the lab team along with experts from multiple other divisions including R&D, Genomics, and Business to build, test, and release, for research use only, a proprietary NGS sequencing kit that utilizes robust NGS reagents in conjunction with a community designed Artic Primer set. Discussion in the lab about implementing NGS took place in February 2021 and by March 2021, we were fully operational and had begun to sequence these positive samples for epidemiological purposes. A streamlined process was established within four weeks using robotic automation as well as training an inexperienced staff running 4 shifts for a 24/7 lab operation. The laboratory utilizes two Illumina platforms, the NovaSeq and MiSeq systems to process high sample throughput and high priority samples. The use of our proprietary NGS kit allows for 1536 unique barcodes so that a high throughput of samples can be run on one flowcell, and this kit design allowed for our lab to utilize a full Illumina S4 flowcell with approximately 6144 samples at a time. Result(s): At this reporting, more than 115,000 samples have been sequenced using the NGS kit to determine the populations of VOCs rampant in California. This is broken up into two workflows: routine high throughput processing on the NovaSeq with a turnaround time of 7 days and STAT sample manual processing on the MiSeq with a turnaround time of 48 hours. The lab can process up to 24 STAT samples daily and an average of 5000 routine patient samples per week. SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples is measured by qPCR; where having a cycle threshold (Ct) cutoff value determines the presence and amount of virus detected in a sample. Of these samples approximately 35% (~39,200) have been weakly detected with a Ct value greater than 33. Samples with high Ct values, which are indicative of lower viral titer traditionally do not meet the requirements for sequencing set forth in other laboratories. Lower viral titer leads to lower nucleic acid concentration which causes under clustering leading to total flowcell failure and more importantly, missed patient results. Conclusion(s): Due to our high throughput automated NGS workflow plus the robust NGS reagents in conjunction with a community designed Artic Primer set, our laboratory was able to successfully sequ nce 40% of these high Ct value sample which would have been rejected elsewhere. Due to our laboratory's unique sequencing methods, the government is able to closely monitor and track emerging VOCs within the state. We have traced the increase of pathogenic variants such as Delta as it first appeared in California, to now circulating in the population at 85% of all VOCs detected. This epidemiological information is a crucial tool in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, providing relevant data to authorities and researchers to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Introduction: As threats to global health evolve, it is imperative that clinical laboratories are prepared to quickly respond through rapid method validation and laboratory scaling for diagnostics and surveillance of emerging infectious diseases. Here we report an optimized workflow using the Illumina COVIDSeq RUO Kits and the NovaSeq 6000 sequencer for high throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 positive patient specimens. Sample preparation for high quality next-generation sequencing (NGS) includes multiple, time-consuming steps to reverse transcribe cDNA, to amplify and index the genome targets, and to pool, quantify, and normalize sequencing libraries. These manual workflows can take up to 48 hours before the samples are loaded to the sequencer. In March 2021, Aegis Sciences BioPharma Laboratory validated a modified workflow to prepare 3072 samples for sequencing in just 10 hours. Method(s): The Illumina COVIDSeq RUO reference guide was used with modifications. Sequencing libraries were generated at 4X efficiency by prepping samples in 384-well PCR plates with modified reaction volumes instead of the recommended 96-well format. Furthermore, custom scripts for Tecan EVO liquid handlers automated the manual pipetting steps resulting in faster and concurrent upstream workflows and lower error rates, and automated sample pooling allowed team members to simultaneously quantify and dilute libraries for loading to the sequencer the same day. Lastly, custom applications were developed to generate plate maps for quality control and sequencing sample sheets for immediate demultiplexing and FASTQ generation following sequencing. Result(s): This customized procedure for use with the Illumina COVIDSeq RUO Kits and the NovaSeq 6000 sequencer allows four team members to prepare (10 hours), sequence (36 hours), analyze (10 hours), and report (8 hours) 3072 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 sequences with an average turnaround time of 4 days. With additional NovaSeq 6000 sequencers (3) and concurrent workflows (8 team members), Aegis can process and report ~27,000 sequences in one week. Conclusion(s): As of November 2021, Aegis has generated >250,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, accounting for 14% of the United States' submissions to the GISAID database. These data include over 400 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages identified in 50 states and Puerto Rico. Through the ability of Aegis Sciences BioPharma Laboratory to rapidly implement and scale this SARS-CoV-2 surveillance sequencing assay, we have made significant contributions to the emergence, identification, and community spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants.Copyright © 2022

AB  - Monitoring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) is critical for public health management of coronavirus disease. Sequencing is resource-intensive and incompletely representative, and not all isolates can be sequenced. Because wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations correlate with coronavirus disease incidence in sewersheds, tracking VOCs through wastewater is appealing. We developed digital reverse transcription PCRs to monitor abundance of select mutations in Alpha and Delta VOCs in wastewater settled solids, applied these to July 2020-August 2021 samples from 2 large US metropolitan sewersheds, and compared results to estimates of VOC abundance from case isolate sequencing. Wastewater measurements tracked closely with case isolate estimates (Alpha, rp 0.82-0.88; Delta, rp 0.97). Mutations were detected in wastewater even at levels <5% of total SARS-CoV-2 RNA and in samples available 1-3 weeks before case isolate results. Wastewater variant monitoring should be strategically deployed to complement case isolate sequencing.

AB  - A resurgence of COVID-19-positive cases has been observed in many countries in the latter half of 2021. The primary reasons for this resurgence are the waning immunity of vaccination after the second dose of vaccination and the changes in public behavior due to temporal convergence. The vaccination effectiveness for the omicron and delta variants has been reported from some countries, but it is still unclear for several other regions worldwide. Here, we numerically derived the effectiveness of vaccination for infection protection in individuals and populations against viral variants for the entire Japanese population (126 million). The waning immunity of vaccination for the delta variant of Japanese individuals was 93.8% (95% CI: 93.1-94.6%) among individuals <65 years of age and 95.0% (95% CI: 95.6-96.9%) among individuals >=65 years of age. We found that waning immunity of vaccination in individuals >65 years of age was lower than in those <65 years of age, which may be attributable to human behavior and a higher vaccination rate among individuals >65 years of age. From the reported data of 25,187 positive cases with confirmed omicron variant in Tokyo in January 2022, the effectiveness of vaccination was also estimated at 62.1% (95% CI: 48-66%) compared to that of the delta variant. Derived effectiveness of vaccination would be useful to discuss the vaccination strategy for the booster shot, as well as the status of herd immunity.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in various disease symptoms and severity, ranging from asymptomatic, through mild, up to very severe and fatal cases. Although environmental, clinical, and social factors play important roles in both susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease progress, it is becoming evident that both pathogen and host genetic factors are important too. Here we report whole-exome sequencing (WES) findings of 27 individuals who died as a result of COVID-19 infection, especially focusing on frequencies of DNA variants in genes previously associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. Results: : We selected risk DNA variants/alleles or target genes using four different approaches: 1) aggregated GWAS results from the GWAS Catalog;2) selected publications from PubMed;3) the aggregated results of the Host Genetics Initiative database;and 4) a commercial DNA variant annotation/interpretation tool providing its own knowledgebase. We divided these variants/genes into those reported to influence the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and those influencing COVID-19 severity. Based on these, we compared frequencies of alleles among the fatal COVID-19 cases to frequencies identified in two population control datasets (non-Finnish European population from the gnomAD database and genomic frequencies specific for the Slovak population from our own database). Our comparisons delineated a trend of higher frequencies of severe COVID-19 associated risk alleles among fatal COVID-19 cases, when compared to both control population datasets. This trend reached statistical significance specifically when using the HGI derived variant list. We also analyzed other approaches to WES data evaluation, where we showed their usage as well as limitations. Conclusions: : Although our results proved the likely involvement of host genetic factors pinned out by previous studies for COVID-19 disease severity, careful considerations about the molecular-testing strategies and the evaluated genomic positions may have a strong impact on the utility of genomic testing.

AB  - Background: Emergence of vaccine-escaping SARS-CoV-2 variants is a serious problem for global public health. The currently rampant Omicron has been shown to possess remarkable vaccine escape; however, the selection pressure exerted by vaccines might pave the way for other escape mutants in the near future. Materials & methods: For detection of neutralizing antibodies, the authors used the recently developed HiBiT-based virus-like particle neutralization test system. Sera after vaccination (two doses of Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine) were used to evaluate the neutralizing activity against various strains of SARS-CoV-2. Results: Beta+R346K, which was identified in the Philippines in August 2021, exhibited the highest vaccine resistance among the tested mutants. Surprisingly, Mu+K417N mutant exhibited almost no decrease in neutralization. Imdevimab retained efficacy against these strains. Conclusions: Mutations outside the receptor-binding domain contributed to vaccine escape. Both genomic surveillance and phenotypic analysis synergistically accelerate identifications of vaccine-escaping strains.

AB  - Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reverberated, posing health and social hygiene obstacles throughout the globe. Mutant lineages of the virus have concerned scientists because of convergent amino acid alterations, mainly on the viral spike protein. Studies have shown that mutants have diminished activity of neutralizing antibodies and enhanced affinity with its human cell receptor, the ACE2 protein. Method(s): Hence, for real-time measuring of the impacts caused by variant strains in such complexes, we implemented E-Volve, a tool designed to model a structure with a list of mutations requested by users and return analyses of the variant protein. As a proof of concept, we scrutinized the spike-antibody and spike-ACE2 complexes formed in the variants of concern, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma), by using contact maps depicting the interactions made amid them, along with heat maps to quantify these major interactions. Result(s): The results found in this study depict the highly frequent interface changes made by the entire set of mutations, mainly conducted by N501Y and E484K. In the spike-Antibody complex, we have noticed alterations concerning electrostatic surface complementarity, breaching essential sites in the P17 and BD-368-2 antibodies. Alongside, the spike-ACE2 complex has presented new hydrophobic bonds. Discussion(s): Molecular dynamics simulations followed by Poisson-Boltzmann calculations corroborate the higher complementarity to the receptor and lower to the antibodies for the K417T/E484K/N501Y (Gamma) mutant compared to the wild-type strain, as pointed by E-Volve, as well as an intensification of this effect by changes at the protein conformational equilibrium in solution. A local disorder of the loop a1'/beta1', as well its possible effects on the affinity to the BD-368-2 antibody were also incorporated to the final conclusions after this analysis. Moreover, E-Volve can depict the main alterations in important biological structures, as shown in the SARSCoV- 2 complexes, marking a major step in the real-time tracking of the virus mutant lineages.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has exhibited varying pathogenesis in a variety of Mammalia family's including Canidae, Mustelidae, Hominidae, Cervidae, Hyaenidae, and Felidae. Novel SARS-CoV-2 variants characterized by spike protein mutations have recently resulted in clinical and epidemiological concerns, as they potentially have increased infectious rates, increased transmission, or reduced neutralization by antibodies produced via vaccination. Many variants have been identified at this time, but the variant of continuing concern has been the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), due to its increased transmissibility and infectious rate. Felines vaccinated using an experimental SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-based veterinary vaccine mounted a robust immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using a reporter virus particle system and feline serum, we have verified that vaccinated felines produce antibodies that neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and variant B.1.617.2 at comparable levels.Copyright © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Alaska is the largest geographic state in the United States with the lowest population density and a mix of urban centers and isolated rural communities. The differences in population dynamics in Alaska from the contiguous United States may have contributed to a unique pattern of emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants observed in early 2021. Here we examined 2,323 virus genomes from Alaska and 278,635 virus genomes from the contiguous United States collected between the first week of December 2020 through the last week of June 2021. We focused on this timeframe because of the notable emergence and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.519 observed in Alaska. We found that this variant was consistently detected in Alaska from the end of January through June of 2021 with a peak prevalence in April of 77.9% unlike the rest of the United States with a peak prevalence of 4.6%. In Alaska, the earlier emergence of B.1.1.519 coincided with a later peak of Alpha (B.1.1.7) when compared to the rest of the United States. We also observed differences in the composition of lineages and variants over time between the two most populated regions of Alaska. Although there was a modest increase in COVID-19 cases during the peak incidence of B.1.1.519, it is difficult to disentangle how social dynamics conflated changes in COVID-19 during this time. We suggest that the viral characteristics, such as amino acid substitutions in the spike protein, and a founder effect likely contributed to the unique spread of B.1.1.519 in Alaska.

AB  - While the world continues to grapple with the devastating effects of the SARS-nCoV-2 virus, different scientific groups, including researchers from different parts of the world, are trying to collaborate to discover solutions to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus permanently. Henceforth, the current study envisions the analysis of predictive models that employ machine learning techniques and mathematical modeling to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. A systematic literature review (SLR) has been conducted, wherein a search into different databases, viz., PubMed and IEEE Explore, fetched 1178 records initially. From an initial of 1178 records, only 50 articles were analyzed completely. Around (64%) of the studies employed data-driven mathematical models, whereas only (26%) used machine learning models. Hybrid and ARIMA models constituted about (5%) and (3%) of the selected articles. Various Quality Evaluation Metrics (QEM), including accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, Brier-score, F1-score, RMSE, AUC, and prediction and validation cohort, were used to gauge the effectiveness of the studied models. The study also considered the impact of Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2), AstraZeneca (ChAd0x1), and Moderna (mRNA-1273) on Beta (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) viral variants and the impact of administering booster doses given the evolution of viral variants of the virus.Copyright © 2022 Afshan Hassan et al.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Since late November 2021, the Omicron variant has emerged as the primary cause of COVID-19 and caused a huge increase in the reported incidence around the world. To date, 32-34 spike mutations have been reported to be present in the Omicron variant, 15 of which were located in the receptor-binding domain that interacts with the cell surface of the host cells, while the rest were located in the N-terminal domain and around the furin cleavage site. Recent studies have suggested that those mutations could have a major role in the transmissibility and pathogenicity of the Omicron variant. Additionally, some mutations might contribute to the change of viral tropism of this novel variant. Here, we aim to discuss the recent reports on the transmissibility and severity of the Omicron variant from both the genetic and clinical perspectives. Afterward, we also take the chance to deliver our personal view on the topic.

AB  - Seychelles, an archipelago of 155 islands in the Indian Ocean, had confirmed 24,788 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the 31st December 2021. The first SARS-CoV-2 cases in Seychelles were reported on the 14th of March 2020, but cases remained low until January 2021, when a surge of SARS-CoV-2 cases was observed on the islands. Here, we investigated the potential drivers of the surge by genomic analysis 1,056 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected in Seychelles between 14th March 2020 and 31st December 2021. The Seychelles genomes were classified into 32 Pango lineages, 1,042 of which fell within four variants of concern i.e., Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron. Sporadic cases of SARS-CoV-2 detected in Seychelles in 2020 were mainly of lineage B.1 (European origin) but this lineage was rapidly replaced by Beta variant starting January 2021, and which was also subsequently replaced by the Delta variant in May 2021 that dominated till November 2021 when Omicron cases were identified. Using ancestral state reconstruction approach, we estimated at least 78 independent SARS-CoV-2 introduction events into Seychelles during the study period. Majority of viral introductions into Seychelles occurred in 2021, despite substantial COVID-19 restrictions in place during this period. We conclude that the surge of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Seychelles in January 2021 was primarily due to the introduction of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants into the islands.

AB  - The Bronx was an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. We conducted temporal genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the Bronx from March-October 2020. Although the local structure of SARS-CoV-2 lineages mirrored those of New York City and New York State, temporal sampling revealed a dynamic and changing landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity. Mapping the trajectories of variants, we found that while some became 'endemic' to the Bronx, other, novel variants rose in prevalence in the late summer/early fall. Geographically resolved genomes enabled us to distinguish between cases of reinfection and persistent infection in two pediatric patients. We propose that limited, targeted, temporal genomic surveillance has clinical and epidemiological utility in managing the ongoing COVID pandemic., One sentence summary: Temporally and geographically resolved sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes enabled surveillance of novel genotypes, identification of endemic viral variants, and clinical inferences, in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Bronx.

AB  - Genomic surveillance has shaped our understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. We performed a global landscape analysis on SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and genomic data using a collection of country-specific data. Here, we characterize increasing circulation of the Alpha variant in early 2021, subsequently replaced by the Delta variant around May 2021. SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and sequencing availability varied markedly across countries, with 45 countries performing a high level of routine genomic surveillance and 96 countries with a high availability of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. We also observed a marked heterogeneity of sequencing percentage, sequencing technologies, turnaround time and completeness of released metadata across regions and income groups. A total of 37% of countries with explicit reporting on variants shared less than half of their sequences of variants of concern (VOCs) in public repositories. Our findings indicate an urgent need to increase timely and full sharing of sequences, the standardization of metadata files and support for countries with limited sequencing and bioinformatics capacity.

AB  - Hepatitis E (HEV) is an important etiological agent causing acute and chronic hepatitis. HEV possesses a single stranded RNA genome with three open reading frames (ORF1 to 3). TheHEVORF1 gene encodes viral nonstructural polyprotein, essential forRNAreplication and crucial for the downregulation of the innate immune response, through inhibition of interferon (IFN) production. The IFN inducible OAS/RNase L system is one of the first antiviral response. It relies on the synthesis of short 2'-5' oligonucleotides (2'5'A) by oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) that activate the latent cellular RNase L. The latter degrades viral and cellular RNAs, restricting the viral infection. Studies on coronaviruses and rotaviruses have showed that the inhibition of the OAS/ RNase L system can be achieved by 2'5'A degradation through a 2'-5'phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity. PDE enzymes bear two conserved catalytic Hx(S/T)x motifs (where x is preferentially a hydrophobic amino acid). Sequence and structural analysis of HEV revealed the presence of this conserved motifs in the following putative HEV ORF1 domains : hypervariable-Macro (HVD-XD), Macro (XD), helicase (HEL) and polymerase (RdRp). The objective of this work is to determine the implication of these catalytic motifs, present in HEV, in the inactivation of the innate immune response. Hence, recombinant proteins corresponding to the domains of interest were produced in E. coli and incubated with 2-5 A oligotrimers. The 2-5 degradation activity was monitored by HPLC separation. The results show that 2-5 A oligotrimers can be modified only when incubated in the presence of HVD-XD and HEL, suggesting that these domains play an important role in viral escape. Finally, this study will contribute to the understanding ofHEVevasion mechanisms, which could ultimately be extrapolated to other RNA viruses with the aim of developing antiviral tools.

AB  - The Omicron sub-lineage BA.2 of SARS-CoV-2 has recently become dominant across many areas in the world in the on-going waves of COVID-19. Compared to the ancestral/wild-type (WT) virus, Omicron lineage variants, both BA.1 and BA.2, contain high number of mutations, especially in the spike protein, causing significant immune escape that leads to substantial reduction of vaccine and antibody efficacy. Because of this antigenic drift, BA.2 exhibited differential resistance profile to monoclonal antibodies than BA.1. Thus, it is important to understand whether the immunity elicited by currently available vaccines are effective against the BA.2 subvariant. We directly tested the heterotypic vaccination responses against Omicron BA.2, using vaccinated serum from animals receiving WT- and variant-specific mRNA vaccine in lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations. Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 antigen showed similar reactivity to serum antibodies elicited by two doses of WT, B.1.351 and B.1.617 LNP-mRNAs. Neutralizing antibody titers of B.1.351 and B.1.617 LNP-mRNA were ~2-fold higher than that of WT LNP-mRNA. Both homologous boosting with WT LNP-mRNA and heterologous boosting with BA.1 LNP-mRNA substantially increased waning immunity of WT vaccinated mice against both BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants. The BA.1 LNP-mRNA booster was ~3-fold more efficient than WT LNP-mRNA at elevating neutralizing antibody titers of BA.2. Together, these data provided a direct preclinical evaluation of WT and variant-specific LNP-mRNAs in standard two-dose and as boosters against BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants.

AB  - Omicron, a highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2, emerged in November 2021. The high mutation rates within spike protein of Omicron raised concerns about increased breakthrough infections among the vaccinated. We tested cross-reactivity of antibodies induced by UB-612 against Omicron and other variants. After 2 doses, UB-612 elicited low levels of neutralization antibodies against ancestral virus and Omicron. A booster dose delivered 7-9 months after primary vaccination dramatically increased antibody levels, with only a 1.4-fold loss in neutralization titer against Omicron compared to the ancestral strain. Using a model bridging vaccine efficacy with ancestral virus RBD binding antibody responses, predicted efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 after UB-612 booster is estimated at 95%. UB-612 is anticipated to be a potent booster against current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. One-Sentence SummaryUB-612 booster induced broadly neutralizing antibodies against Omicron and is presumed to be protective against COVID-19.

AB  - Background The Sinovac SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac) has been demonstrated to be safe, well tolerated, and efficacious in preventing mild and severe Covid-19. Although different studies have demonstrated its short-term immunogenicity, long-term cellular and humoral response evaluations are still lacking. Methods Cellular and humoral responses were assessed after enrollment of volunteers in the PROFISCOV phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate CoronaVac. Assays were performed using flow cytometry to evaluate cellular immune response and an antigen binding electrochemiluminescence assay to detect antigen-specific antibodies to the virus. Results Fifty-three volunteers were selected for long term assessment of their SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses. CD4 + T cell responses (including circulating follicular helper (cTfh, CD45RA - CXCR5 + ) expressing CD40L, as well as non-cTfh cells expressing CXCR3) were observed early upon the first vaccine dose, increased after the second dose, remaining stable for 6-months. Memory CD4 + T cells were detected in almost all vaccinees, the majority being central memory T cells. IgG levels against Wuhan/WH04/2020 N, S and receptor binding domain (RBD) antigens and the variants of concern (VOCs, including B.1.1.7/Alpha, B.1.351/Beta and P.1/Gamma) S and RBD antigens peaked 14 days after the second vaccine shot, and were mostly stable for a 1-year period. Conclusions CoronaVac two-doses regimen is able to induce a potent and durable SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular response. The cellular reaction is part of a coordinated immune response that includes high levels of specific IgG levels against parental and SARS-CoV-2 VOC strains, still detected after one year.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by binding of the viral spike protein to its receptor, ACE2, on the surface of host cells. ACE2 expression is heterogeneous both in vivo and in immortalized cell lines, but the molecular pathways that govern ACE2 expression remain unclear. We now report high-throughput CRISPR screens for functional modifiers of ACE2 surface abundance. In liver-derived HuH7 cells, we identified 35 genes whose disruption was associated with a change in the surface abundance of ACE2. Enriched among these ACE2 regulators were established transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, and functional networks. We further characterized individual HuH7 cell lines with disruption of SMAD4, EP300, PIAS1, or BAMBI and found these genes to regulate ACE2 at the mRNA level and to influence cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Orthogonal screening of lung-derived Calu-3 cells revealed a distinct set of ACE2 modifiers comprised of ACE2, KDM6A, MOGS, GPAA1, and UGP2. Collectively, our findings clarify the host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, highlight the cell type specificity of ACE2 regulatory networks, and suggest potential targets for therapeutic development.

AB  - In healthy adults, hybrid immunity induced by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection followed by two doses of mRNA vaccination provide protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the role of hybrid immunity in autoimmune patients against Omicron is not well documented. Here, we report a young autoimmune patient with prior infection and two doses of mRNA-1273 vaccination who was exposed to Omicron and developed a symptomatic disease. Prior to Omicron infection, the patient had strong neutralizing antibody titers against the vaccine strain, but no neutralization of Omicron. Post Omicron infection, high neutralizing titers against Omicron were observed. Furthermore, enhanced neutralizing antibody titers against other variants of concern-Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta-were observed, suggesting an expansion of cross-reactive memory B-cell response by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. Autoimmune patients may require careful monitoring of immune function over time to optimize booster vaccine administration.

AB  - BackgroundOptimum formulation of Biological Es CORBEVAX vaccine that contains protein sub unit of Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from the spike protein of SARS-COV-2 formulated with aluminum hydroxide (Al3+) and CpG1018 as adjuvants was selected in phase-1 and 2 studies and proven to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic in healthy adult population. In the current study, additional data was generated to determine immunogenic superiority of CORBEVAX vaccine over COVISHIELD vaccine and safety in larger and older population. MethodsThis is a phase III prospective, single blinded, randomized, active controlled study (CTRI/2021/08/036074) conducted at 20 sites across India in healthy adults aged between 18-80 years. This study has two arms; immunogenicity arm and safety arm. Participants in immunogenicity arm were randomized equally to either CORBEVAX or COVISHIELD vaccination groups to determine the immunogenic superiority. Healthy adults without a history of Covid-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection, were enrolled. FindingsThe safety profile of CORBEVAX vaccine was comparable to the comparator vaccine COVISHIELD in terms of overall AE rates, related AE rates and medically attended AEs. Majority of reported AEs were mild in nature, and overall CORBEVAX appeared to cause fewer local and systemic adverse reactions/events. Overall, two grade-3 serious AEs (Dengue fever and femur fracture) were reported and they are unrelated to study vaccine. Neutralizing Antibody titers, against both Ancestral and Delta strain, induced post two-dose vaccination regimen were higher in the CORBEVAX arm as compared to COVISHIELD and the analysis of GMT ratios demonstrated immunogenic superiority of CORBEVAX in comparison with COVISHIELD. Both CORBEVAX and COVISHIELD vaccines showed comparable seroconversion post vaccination when assessed against anti-RBD IgG response. The subjects in CORBEVAX cohort also exhibited higher Interferon-gamma secreting PBMCs post stimulation with SARS-COV-2 RBD peptides than the subjects in COVISHIELD cohort. InterpretationsNeutralizing antibody titers induced by CORBEVAX vaccine against Delta and Ancestral strains were protective, indicative of vaccine effectiveness of >90% for prevention of symptomatic infections based on the Correlates of Protection assessment performed during Moderna and Astra-Zeneca vaccine Phase III studies. Safety findings revealed that CORBEVAX vaccine has excellent safety profile when tested in larger and older population.

AB  - BackgroundBefore the availability of vaccines, countries largely relied on mobility restriction and testing to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim is to assess the combined impact of mobility restriction, testing, and vaccination on the COVID-19 pandemic in India. MethodsWe conducted a multiple regression analysis to assess the impact of mobility, testing, and vaccination on COVID-19 incidence between April 28, 2021 to November 24, 2021 using data from Our World in Data and Google Mobility Report. The 7-day moving average was applied to offset the daily fluctuations in the mobility and testing. Each independent variable was lagged to construct a temporal relationship, and waning vaccination efficacy was taken into consideration. We performed additional analysis for three time periods between March 28, 2020 to November 24, 2021 (1st: March 28, 2020 [~] October 7, 2020, 2nd: October 8, 2020 [~] April 27, 2021, 3rd: April 28, 2021 [~] November 24, 2021) to examine potential heterogeneity over time. ResultsMobility (0.041, 95% CI: 0.033 to 0.048), testing (-0.008, 95% CI: -0.015 to -0.001), and vaccination (quadratic term: 0.004, 95% CI: 0.003 to 0.005, linear term: -0.130, 95% CI: -0.161 to -0.099) were all associated with COVID-19 incidence. For vaccination rate, the decrease of number of cases demonstrated a U-shaped curve, while mobility showed a positive association and testing showed an inverse association with COVID-19 incidence. Mobility restriction was effective during all three periods - March 28, 2020 to November 24, 2021 (0.009, 0.048, and 0.026 respectively). Testing was effective during the second and third period - October 8, 2020 to November 24, 2021 (-0.036, and -0.006 respectively). ConclusionMobility restriction and testing were effective even in the presence of vaccination. This shows the positive value of mobility restrictions, testing, and vaccination from the health system perspective on COVID-19 prevention and control, especially with continual emergence of variants in India and globally. At the same time, this health system gain must be balanced with the challenges in the delivery of non-COVID health services and broader socio-economic impact in deciding the prolonged continuance of mobility restriction.

AB  - The emergence of several new variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in recent months has raised concerns around the potential impact on ongoing vaccination programs. Data from clinical trials and real-world evidence suggest that current vaccines remain highly effective against the alpha variant (B.1.1.7), while some vaccines have reduced efficacy and effectiveness against symptomatic disease caused by the beta variant (B.1.351) and the delta variant (B.1.617.2); however, effectiveness against severe disease and hospitalization caused by delta remains high. Although data on the effectiveness of the primary regimen against omicron (B.1.1.529) are limited, booster programs using mRNA vaccines have been shown to restore protection against infection and symptomatic disease (regardless of the vaccine used for the primary regimen) and maintain high effectiveness against hospitalization. However, effectiveness against infection and symptomatic disease wanes with time after the booster dose. Studies have demonstrated reductions of varying magnitude in neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies against a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants, with the omicron variant in particular exhibiting partial immune escape. However, evidence suggests that T-cell responses are preserved across vaccine platforms, regardless of variant of concern. Nevertheless, various mitigation strategies are under investigation to address the potential for reduced efficacy or effectiveness against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants, including modification of vaccines for certain variants (including omicron), multivalent vaccine formulations, and different delivery mechanisms.

AB  - We studied 249,070 patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the Cleveland Clinic Health System between October 1, 2021 and January 31, 2022. We found that vaccination, especially with recent boosting, was more effective than prior infection and monoclonal antibody therapy against both the delta and omicron variants. Vaccination and prior infection were much less effective against infection with the omicron variant than with the delta variant, but the opposite was true of death after infection. Boosting greatly increased the effectiveness of the two mRNA vaccines against both infection and death, although its effects waned markedly after 6 months. In addition, monoclonal antibody therapy was notably less effective at preventing death from the omicron variant than from the delta variant. Finally, the relatively low mortality of the omicron variant was due to both the reduced lethality of this variant and the increased population immunity acquired from booster vaccination and previous infection.

AB  - Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, mutations have led to the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, and some of these have become prominent or dominant variants of concern. This natural course of development can have an impact on how protective the previously naturally or vaccine induced immunity is. Therefore, it is crucial to understand whether and how variant specific mutations influence host immunity. To address this, we have investigated how mutations in the recent SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and concern influence epitope sequence similarity, predicted binding affinity to HLA, and immunogenicity of previously reported SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T cell epitopes. Our data suggests that the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T cell recognized epitopes are not altered by variant specific mutations. Interestingly, for the CD8 T cell epitopes that are altered due to variant specific mutations, our analyses show there is a high degree of sequence similarity between mutated and reference SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T cell epitopes. However, mutated epitopes, primarily derived from the spike protein, in SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta, AY.4.2 and Mu display reduced predicted binding affinity to their restriction element. These findings indicate that the recent SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and concern have limited ability to escape memory CD8 T cell responses raised by vaccination or prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic. The overall low impact of the mutations on CD8 T cell cross-recognition is in accordance with the notion that mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are primarily the result of receptor binding affinity and antibody selection pressures exerted on the spike protein, unrelated to T cell immunity.

AB  - ObjectiveTo determine how the severity of successively dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants has changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. DesignProspective cohort analysis. SettingCommunity- and hospital- sequenced COVID-19 cases in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHS GG&C) Health Board (1.2 million people). ParticipantsAll sequenced non-nosocomial adult COVID-19 cases in NHS GG&C identified to be infected with the relevant SARS-CoV-2 lineage during the following analysis periods. B.1.177/Alpha analysis: 1st November 2020 - 30th January 2021 (n = 1640). Alpha/Delta analysis: 1st April - 30th June 2021 (n = 5552). AY.4.2 Delta/non-AY.4.2 Delta analysis: 1st July - 31st October 2021 (n = 9613). Non-AY.4.2 Delta/Omicron analysis: 1st - 31st December 2021 (n = 3858). Main outcome measuresAdmission to hospital, admission to ICU, or death within 28 days of first positive COVID-19 test ResultsIn the B.1.177/Alpha analysis, 300 of 807 (37.2%) B.1.177 cases were recorded as hospitalised or having a more severe outcome, compared to 232 of 833 (27.9%) Alpha cases. After adjusting for the following covariates: age, sex, time of positive test, comorbidities and partial postcode, the cumulative odds ratio was 1.51 (95% central credible interval 1.08-2.11) for Alpha versus B.1.177. In the Alpha/Delta analysis, 113 of 2104 (5.4%) Alpha cases were recorded as hospitalised or having a more severe outcome, compared to 230 of 3448 (6.7%) Delta cases. After adjusting for the above covariates plus number of vaccine doses and reinfection, the cumulative odds ratio was 2.09 (95% central credible interval 1.42-3.08) for Delta versus Alpha. In the non-AY.4.2 Delta/AY.4.2 Delta analysis, 845 of 8644 (9.8%) non-AY.4.2 Delta cases were recorded as hospitalised or having a more severe outcome, compared to 101 of 969 (10.4%) AY.4.2 Delta cases. After adjusting for the previously stated covariates, the cumulative odds ratio was 0.99 (95% central credible interval 0.76-1.27) for AY.4.2 Delta versus non-AY.4.2 Delta. In the non-AY.4.2 Delta/Omicron analysis, 30 of 1164 (2.6%) non-AY.4.2 Delta cases were recorded as hospitalised or having a more severe outcome, compared to 26 of 2694 (1.0%) Omicron cases. After adjusting for the previously listed covariates, the median cumulative odds ratio was 0.49 (95% central credible interval 0.22-1.06) for Omicron versus non-AY.4.2 Delta. ConclusionsThe direction of change in disease severity between successively emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern was inconsistent. This heterogeneity in virulence between variants, coupled with independent evolutionary emergence, demonstrates that severity associated with future SARS-CoV-2 variants is inherently unpredictable.

AB  - Background: Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants of concern (VOCs) have repeatedly and independently arisen. VOCs are characterised by increased transmissibility, increased virulence or reduced neutralisation by antibodies obtained from prior infection or vaccination. Tracking the introduction and transmission of VOCs relies on sequencing, typically whole genome sequencing of clinical samples. Wastewater surveillance is increasingly used to track the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants through sequencing approaches. Aim(s): Here, we adapt and apply a rapid, high-throughput method for detection and quantification of the relative frequency of two deletions characteristic of the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma VOCs in wastewater. Method(s): We developed drop-off RT-dPCR assays and an associated statistical approach implemented in the R package WWdPCR to analyse temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 signature mutations (spike DELTA69-70 and ORF1a DELTA3675-3677) in wastewater and quantify transmission fitness advantage of the Alpha VOC. Result(s): Based on analysis of Zurich wastewater samples, the estimated transmission fitness advantage of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha based on the spike DELTA69-70 was 0.34 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30-0.39) and based on ORF1a DELTA3675-3677 was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.49-0.57), aligning with the transmission fitness advantage of Alpha estimated by clinical sample sequencing in the surrounding canton of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.38-0.61). Conclusion(s): Digital PCR assays targeting signature mutations in wastewater offer near real-time monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and potentially earlier detection and inference on transmission fitness advantage than clinical sequencing.Copyright © 2022 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

AB  - Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic drastically reduced human-to-human interactions, decreasing the circulation of other respiratory viruses as well. As a consequence, influenza virus circulation - normally responsible for 3-5 million hospitalizations per year globally - was significantly reduced. With downscaling the NPI countermeasures, there is a concern for increased influenza disease, particularly in individuals suffering from post-acute effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate this possibility, we performed a sequential influenza H1N1 infection 4 weeks after an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection in the ferret model. Upon H1N1 infection, ferrets that were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed an increased tendency to develop clinical symptoms compared to the control H1N1 infected animals. Histopathological analysis indicated only a slight increase for type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and bronchitis. The effects of the sequential infection thus appeared minor. However, ferrets were infected with B.1.351-SARS-CoV-2, the beta variant of concern, which replicated poorly in our model. The histopathology of the respiratory organs was mostly resolved 4 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with only reminiscent histopathological features in the upper respiratory tract. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular and humoral responses were observed, confirming an established infection. Thus, there may likely be a SARS-CoV-2 variant-dependent effect on the severity of disease upon a sequential influenza infection as we observed mild effects upon a mild infection. It, however, remains to be determined what the impact is of more virulent SARS-CoV-2 variants. ImportanceDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of face masks, social distancing and isolation were not only effective in decreasing the circulation of SARS-CoV-2, but also in reducing other respiratory viruses such as influenza. With less restrictions, influenza is slowly returning. In the meantime, people still suffering from long-COVID, could be more vulnerable to an influenza virus infection and develop more severe influenza disease. This study provides directions to the effect of a previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure on influenza disease severity in the ferret model. This model is highly valuable to test sequential infections under controlled settings for translation to humans. We could not induce clear long-term COVID-19 effects as SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets was mild. However, we still observed a slight increase in influenza disease severity compared to ferrets that had not encountered SARS-CoV-2 before. It may therefore be advisable to include long-COVID patients as a risk group for influenza vaccination.

AB  - Rationale: Mutations of SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), could impede drug development and reduce the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we developed a multiplexed Spike-ACE2 Inhibitor Screening (mSAIS) assay that can measure the neutralizing effect of antibodies across numerous variants of the coronavirus's Spike (S) protein simultaneously. Method(s): The SARS-CoV-2 spike variant protein microarrays were prepared by printing 72 S variants onto a chemically-modified glass slides. The neutralization potential of purified anti-S antibodies and serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients and vaccinees to S variants were assessed with the mSAIS assay. Result(s): We identified new S mutations that are sensitive and resistant to neutralization. Serum from both infected and vaccinated groups with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) displayed a broader capacity to neutralize S variants than serum with low titer NAbs. These data were validated using serum from a large vaccinated cohort (n = 104) with a tiled S peptide microarray. In addition, similar results were obtained using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay specific for wild-type S and five prevalent S variants (D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.617.2), thus demonstrating that high antibody diversity is associated with high NAb titers. Conclusion(s): Our results demonstrate the utility of the mSAIS platform in screening NAbs. Moreover, we show that heterogeneous antibody populations provide a more protective effect against S variants, which may help direct COVID-19 vaccine and drug development.Copyright © 2022 Ivyspring International Publisher.

AB  - SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) has resulted in over 4 million deaths worldwide. While vaccination has decreased mortality, there remains a need for curative therapies for active infections. Uncertainties regarding the duration of post-vaccination immunity and the rapidity of mutational evolution by this virus suggest that it is unwise to rely on preventative measures alone. Humoral and cellular immunity provide selective pressure for the emergence of variant strains which have eliminated target epitopes. Elimination of immunodominant epitopes provides the strongest advantage to newly emerging strains and, consequently, immunodominant epitopes would be expected to be preferentially eliminated compared to subdominant epitopes in emerging variants. Immunologic treatments for SARS-COV-2 need to be continuously reassessed as new sequence information becomes available. TVGN-489 is a clinical grade product consisting of highly enriched, highly potent CD8+ CTLs recognizing peptides derived from COVID- 19 gene/ORF products in an HLA restricted manner. CTLs are generated from apheresis products from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infections. Lymphocytes are serially primed and selected using APCs from these donors pulsed with small numbers of peptides encoded by the COVID-19 genome predicted or demonstrated to bind to specific HLA class I alleles. The resulting products are typically >95% CD3+/CD8+, >60% positive by tetramer staining and demonstrate strong cytolytic activity with >60% lysis of peptide pulsed targets typically at an effector to target ratio of 3:1 (See Figure). Given the immunologic pressure to lose dominant target epitopes, we assessed whether the peptides derived from genomic sequences from early SARS-COV-2 strains (and successfully used to generate CTLs from donors infected with these early strains) were still present in the more recently evolved Delta variant. Seven peptides were used to generate CTL products restricted by HLA-A*02:01, the most common allele worldwide. These peptides are derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as well as ORF3a and ORF1ab. The contributions of these peptides to the overall cytotoxicity and tetramer staining range from 2% to 18% without clear immunodominance by one of these peptides. Though identified in early viral strains, these sequences persist in 97.5%-100% of the more than 120 Delta variant sequences present in the NIH database. For HLA-A*01:01, eight peptides derived from the matrix (M) protein as well as ORF1ab and ORF3a were utilized to generate CTLs. Seven of the eight peptides showed binding similar to what was seen with the HLA-A*02:01 peptides (1% to 18%). However, in contrast to HLA-A*02:01, an immunodominant peptide (TTDPSFLGRY, ORF1ab 1637-1646) was noted which was responsible for over half of the observed tetramer binding. This region of ORF1ab was mutated in the Delta variant resulting in loss of this immunodominant epitope from nearly 93% of the Delta genomic sequences in the NIH database. The remaining subdominant peptides were all preserved in 100% of the sequences. Given the growing number of Delta cases, it will be essential to remove this peptide from the HLA-A*01:01 peptide pool used to stimulate SARS-COV-2-specific CD8+ CTLs to avoid encouraging the expansion of cells which would recognize early strains of the virus, but not Delta variants. The remaining CTLs, generated in the absence of TTDPSFLGRY, should be capable of eradicating Delta as well as the earlier prototypic strains of COVID-19. The loss of immunodominant epitopes is not surprising in a virus such as SARS-COV-2, with a high frequency of mutation. This provides an example of immunologic escape similar to what has been described for the Delta variant in the case of HLA-A24. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that immunodominant epitopes will be preferentially eliminated as the virus continues to evolve. They further illustrate the need to monitor viral sequences and to tune the production of CTLs in order to ensure that they can continue to recognize and fectively treat newly emerging variants of COVID-19.

AB  - Genomic data plays an essential role in the study of transmissible disease, as exemplified by its current use in identifying and tracking the spread of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, with the increase in size of genomic epidemiological datasets, their phylogenetic analyses become increasingly impractical due to high computational demand. In particular, while maximum likelihood methods are go-to tools for phylogenetic inference, the scale of datasets from the ongoing pandemic has made apparent the urgent need for more computationally efficient approaches. Here we propose a new likelihood-based phylogenetic framework that greatly reduces both the memory and time demand of popular maximum likelihood approaches when analysing many closely related genomes, as in the scenario of SARS-CoV-2 genome data and more generally throughout genomic epidemiology. To achieve this, we rewrite the classical Felsenstein pruning algorithm so that we can infer phylogenetic trees on at least 10 times larger datasets with higher accuracy than existing maximum likelihood methods. Our algorithms provide a powerful framework for maximum-likelihood genomic epidemiology and could facilitate similarly groundbreaking applications in Bayesian phylogenomic analyses as well.

AB  - Both feline coronavirus (FCoV) and SARS-CoV-2 are coronaviruses that infect cats and humans, respectively. However, cats have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and FCoV also had been shown to infect human. To elucidate the relationship between FCoV and SARS-CoV-2, we highlight the main characteristics of the genome, the receptor usage, and the correlation of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike proteins in FCoV and SARS-CoV-2. It is demonstrated that FCoV and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related to the main characteristics of the genome, receptor usage, and RBD of spike proteins with similar furin cleavage sites. In particular, the affinity of the conserved feline angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (fACE2) receptor to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, cross-species of coronaviruses between cats and humans or other domesticated animals are also discussed. This review sheds light on cats as potential intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and cross-species transmission or zoonotic infection of FCoV and SARS-CoV-2 between cats and humans was identified.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BackgroundSignificant immune escape by the Omicron variant, along with the emergence of widespread worry fatigue, have called into question the robustness of the previously observed relation between population mobility and COVID-19 incidence. MethodsWe employed principal component analysis to construct a one-dimensional summary indicator of six Google mobility categories. We related this mobility indicator to case incidence among 111 of the most populous U.S. counties during the Omicron surge from December 2021 through February 2022. ResultsReported COVID-19 incidence peaked earlier and declined more rapidly among those counties exhibiting more extensive decline in mobility between December 20 and January 3. Based upon a fixed-effects, longitudinal cohort model, we estimated that every 1-percent decline in mobility between December 20 and January 3 was associated with a 0.63 percent decline in peak incidence during the week ending January 17 (95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.86 percent). Based upon a cross-sectional analysis including mean household size and vaccination participation as covariates, we estimated that the same 1-percent decline in mobility was associated with a 0.36 percent decline in cumulative reported COVID-19 incidence from January 10 through February 28 (95% CI, 0.18-0.54 percent). ConclusionOmicron did not simply sweep through the U.S. population until it ran out of susceptible individuals to infect. To the contrary, a significant fraction managed to avoid infection by engaging in risk-mitigating behaviors. More broadly, the behavioral response to perceived risk should be viewed as an intrinsic component of the natural course of epidemics in humans.

AB  - Documenting the circulation dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants in different regions of the world is crucial for monitoring virus transmission worldwide and contributing to global efforts towards combating the pandemic. Tunisia has experienced several waves of COVID-19 with a significant number of infections and deaths. The present study provides genetic information on the different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 that circulated in Tunisia over 17 months. Lineages were assigned for 1359 samples using whole-genome sequencing, partial S gene sequencing and variant-specific real-time RT-PCR tests. Forty-eight different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 were identified, including variants of concern (VOCs), variants of interest (VOIs) and variants under monitoring (VUMs), particularly Alpha, Beta, Delta, A.27, Zeta and Eta. The first wave, limited to imported and import-related cases, was characterized by a small number of positive samples and lineages. During the second wave, a large number of lineages were detected; the third wave was marked by the predominance of the Alpha VOC, and the fourth wave was characterized by the predominance of the Delta VOC. This study adds new genomic data to the global context of COVID-19, particularly from the North African region, and highlights the importance of the timely molecular characterization of circulating strains.

AB  - Coronaviruses cause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans. By the end of 2019, there was an epidemic of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses have highly mutable genome that makes them genetically and phenotypically modifiable with a potential transmission to new host species. Based on current sequence databases, all human coronaviruses have animal origins so animals have important roles in virus spillover to humans. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of different animal species in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Egypt. A pan-coronaviruses RT-PCR has been used for detection of possible coronaviruses infection in different species including bats, humans, birds, and dogs in Egypt during the period of November 2020 till June 2021. Ninety-two samples (46 from bats ( Rousettus aegyptiacus ), 10 from human, 26 from wild birds, and 10 from dogs) were screened for SARS-CoV-2. Our results revealed that only human samples were SARS-CoV-2 positive for SARS-CoV-2 while all other animal and bird samples were negative. To recapitulate, our results suggest that animals may not actively transmit SARS-CoV-2 among people in Egypt during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Further structural surveillance and follow up screening for SARS-CoV-2 among domestic and wild animal populations in Egypt is crucially needed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus, the international community has been concerned about the emergence of mutations altering some biological properties of the pathogen like increasing its infectivity or virulence. Particularly, since the end of 2020, several variants of concern have been identified around the world, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2). However, the existing mechanism of detecting important mutations are not always effective enough, since only a relatively small part of all pathogen samples can be examined by whole genome sequencing due to its high cost., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, we have designed special primer panel and used it for targeted highthroughput sequencing of several significant S-gene (spike) regions of SARS-CoV-2. The Illumina platform averaged approximately 50,000 paired-end reads with a length of >=150 bp per sample. This method was used to examine 579 random samples obtained from COVID-19 patients in Moscow and the Moscow region from February to June 2021., RESULTS: This study demonstrated the dynamics of distribution of several SARS-CoV-2 strains and its some single mutations. It was found that the Delta strain appeared in the region in May 2021, and became prevalent in June, partially displacing other strains., DISCUSSION: The obtained results provide an opportunity to assign the viral samples to one of the strains, including the previously mentioned in time- and cost-effective manner. The approach can be used for standardization of the procedure of searching for mutations in individual regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. It allows to get a more detailed data about the epidemiological situation in a region.

AB  - Large-scale populations in the world have been vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines, however, breakthrough infections of SARS-CoV-2 are still growing rapidly due to the emergence of immune-evasive variants, especially Omicron. It is urgent to develop effective broad-spectrum vaccines to better control the pandemic of these variants. Here, we present a mosaic-type trimeric form of spike receptor-binding domain (mos-tri-RBD) as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate, which carries the key mutations from Omicron and other circulating variants. Tests in rats showed that the designed mos-tri-RBD, whether used alone or as a booster shot, elicited potent cross-neutralizing antibodies against not only Omicron but also other immune-evasive variants. Neutralizing antibody titers induced by mos-tri-RBD were substantially higher than those elicited by homo-tri-RBD (containing homologous RBDs from prototype strain) or the inactivated vaccine BBIBP-CorV. Our study indicates that mos-tri-RBD is highly immunogenic, which may serve as a broad-spectrum vaccine candidate in combating SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron.

AB  - The successful development of several coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines has substantially reduced morbidity and mortality in regions of the world where the vaccines have been deployed. However, in the wake of the emergence of viral variants that are able to evade vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies, real-world vaccine efficacy has begun to show differences across the two approved mRNA platforms, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273; these findings suggest that subtle variation in immune responses induced by the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines may confer differential protection. Given our emerging appreciation for the importance of additional antibody functions beyond neutralization, we profiled the post-boost binding and functional capacity of humoral immune responses induced by the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines in a cohort of hospital staff. Both vaccines induced robust humoral immune responses to wild-type severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to variants of concern. However, differences emerged across epitope-specific responses, with higher concentrations of receptor binding domain (RBD)- and N-terminal domain-specific IgA observed in recipients of mRNA-1273. Antibodies eliciting neutrophil phagocytosis and natural killer cell activation were also increased in mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients as compared to BNT162b2 recipients. RBD-specific antibody depletion highlighted the different roles of non-RBD-specific antibody effector functions induced across the mRNA vaccines. These data provide insights into potential differences in protective immunity conferred by these vaccines.

AB  - Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic there is still a need for vaccines to effectively control the spread of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants and associated cases of severe disease. Here we report a messenger RNA vaccine directly encoding for a nanoparticle displaying 60 receptor binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-2 that acts as a highly effective antigen. A construct encoding the RBD of the delta variant elicits robust neutralizing antibody response with neutralizing titers an order of magnitude above currently approved mRNA vaccines. The construct also provides protective immunity against the delta variant in a widely used transgenic mouse model. We ultimately find that the proposed mRNA RBD nanoparticle-based vaccine provides a flexible platform for rapid development and will likely be of great value in combatting current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

AB  - Diagnostic assays currently used to monitor the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines measure levels of antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (RBDwt). However, the predictive value for protection against new variants of concern (VOCs) has not been firmly established. Here, we used bead-based arrays and flow cytometry to measure binding of antibodies to spike proteins and receptor-binding domains (RBDs) from VOCs in 12,000 sera. Effects of sera on RBD-ACE2 interactions were measured as a proxy for neutralizing antibodies. The samples were obtained from healthy individuals or patients on immunosuppressive therapy who had received two to four doses of COVID-19 vaccines and from COVID-19 convalescents. The results show that anti-RBDwt titers correlate with the levels of binding- and neutralizing antibodies against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Omicron variants. The benefit of multiplexed analysis lies in the ability to measure a wide range of anti-RBD titers using a single dilution of serum for each assay. The reactivity patterns also yield an internal reference for neutralizing activity and binding antibody units per milliliter (BAU/ml). Results obtained with sera from vaccinated healthy individuals and patients confirmed and extended results from previous studies on time-dependent waning of antibody levels and effects of immunosuppressive agents. We conclude that anti-RBDwt titers correlate with levels of neutralizing antibodies against VOCs and propose that our method may be implemented to enhance the precision and throughput of immunomonitoring.

AB  - Coronaviridae is a large family of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that has plagued the world since it was discovered in humans in the 1960s. The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 pandemic has already exceeded the number of combined cases and deaths witnessed during previous SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV epidemics in the last two decades. This narrative review focuses on genomic mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and their impact on the severity and progression of COVID-19 in light of reported data in the literature. Notable SARS-CoV-2 mutations associated with open reading frames, the S glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid protein, currently circulating globally, are discussed along with emerging mutations such as those in the SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 variant in the UK and other European countries, the 484K.V2 and P.1 variants in Brazil, the B.1.617 variant in India, and South African variants 501Y.V2 and B.1.1.529 (omicron). These variants have the potential to influence the receptor binding domain, host-virus fusion, and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Correlating these mutations with disease dynamics could help us understand their pathogenicity and design appropriate therapeutics.

AB  - The newly emerged Omicron SARS-CoV-2 has 3 distinct sublineages: BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3. BA.1 accounts for the initial surge and is being replaced by BA.2, whereas BA.3 is at a low prevalence at this time. Here we report the neutralization of BNT162b2-vaccinated sera (collected at 1 month after dose 3) against the three Omicron sublineages. To facilitate the neutralization testing, we engineered the complete BA.1, BA.2, or BA.3 spike into an mNeonGreen USA-WA1/2020 SRAS-CoV-2. All BNT162b2-vaccinated sera neutralized USA-WA1/2020, BA.1-, BA.2-, and BA.3-spike SARS-CoV-2s with titers of >20; the neutralization geometric mean titers (GMTs) against the four viruses were 1211, 336, 300, and 190, respectively. Thus, the BA.1-, BA.2-, and BA.3-spike SARS-CoV-2s were 3.6-, 4.0-, and 6.4-fold less efficiently neutralized than the USA-WA1/2020, respectively. Our data have implications in vaccine strategy and understanding the biology of Omicron sublineages.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concerns regarding possible decreases in vaccine effectiveness. Here, neutralizing antibody titers elicited by mRNA-based and adenoviral vector-based vaccines against variant pseudotyped viruses were measured. BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273-elicited antibodies showed modest neutralization resistance against Beta, Delta, Delta plus and Lambda variants whereas Ad26.COV2.S-elicited antibodies from a significant fraction of vaccinated individuals had less neutralizing titer (IC50 <50). The data underscore the importance of surveillance for breakthrough infections that result in severe COVID-19 and suggest a potential benefit by second immunization following Ad26.COV2.S to increase protection from current and future variants.

AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) with major spike protein mutations has raised concern over potential neutralization escape and breakthrough infections among vaccinated and previously SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects. We measured cross-protective antibodies against variants in health care workers (HCW, n = 20) and nursing home residents (n = 9) from samples collected at 1-2 months, following the booster (3rd) dose. We also assessed the antibody responses in subjects infected before the Omicron era (n = 38) with subsequent administration of a single mRNA vaccine dose. Following booster vaccination, HCWs had high IgG antibody concentrations to the spike protein and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were detectable against all variants. IgG concentrations among the elderly remained lower, and some lacked NAbs against the Beta and Omicron variants. NAb titers were significantly reduced against Delta, Beta, and Omicron compared to WT virus regardless of age. Vaccination induced high IgG concentrations and variable titers of cross-reactive NAbs in previously infected subjects, whereas NAb titers against Omicron were barely detectable 1 month postinfection. High IgG concentrations with cross-protective neutralizing activity were detected after three Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine doses in HCWs. However, lower NAb titers seen in the frail elderly suggest inadequate protection against Omicron breakthrough infections, yet protection against severe COVID-19 is expected.

AB  - While SARS-CoV-2 continues to adapt for human infection and transmission, genetic variation outside of the spike gene remains largely unexplored. This study investigates a highly variable region at residues 203-205 in the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Recreating a mutation found in the alpha and omicron variants in an early pandemic (WA-1) background, we find that the R203K+G204R mutation is sufficient to enhance replication, fitness, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. The R203K+G204R mutant corresponds with increased viral RNA and protein both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the R203K+G204R mutation increases nucleocapsid phosphorylation and confers resistance to inhibition of the GSK-3 kinase, providing a molecular basis for increased virus replication. Notably, analogous alanine substitutions at positions 203+204 also increase SARS-CoV-2 replication and augment phosphorylation, suggesting that infection is enhanced through ablation of the ancestral RG motif. Overall, these results demonstrate that variant mutations outside spike are key components in SARS-CoV-2s continued adaptation to human infection. Author SummarySince its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has continued to adapt for human infection resulting in the emergence of variants with unique genetic profiles. Most studies of genetic variation have focused on spike, the target of currently available vaccines, leaving the importance of variation elsewhere understudied. Here, we characterize a highly variable motif at residues 203-205 in nucleocapsid. Recreating the prominent nucleocapsid R203K+G204R mutation in an early pandemic background, we show that this mutation is alone sufficient to enhance SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. We also link augmentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by the R203K+G204R mutation to its modulation of nucleocapsid phosphorylation. Finally, we characterize an analogous alanine double substitution at positions 203-204. This mutant was found to mimic R203K+G204R, suggesting augmentation of infection occurs by disrupting the ancestral sequence. Together, our findings illustrate that mutations outside of spike are key components of SARS-CoV-2s adaptation to human infection.

AB  - A correlation hypothesis between the level of vaccination and the rate of spread of the new Covid-19 variant is investigated based on the case and vaccination data from European and North American jurisdictions available in the public domain at the time point of past the crest of the Omicron wave in most jurisdictions. Statistical variables describing the rate of the spread based on observed new case statistics defined and discussed. An unexpected moderate positive correlation between the rate of the variant spread measured by two related parameters and vaccination level based on the dataset in the study is reported. While negative correlation was not statistically excluded, the analysis of the data in the study statistically excluded a moderate to strong negative correlation. The results of this work, if confirmed by further independent studies can have implications for development of policies aimed at controlling future course of the Covid-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: Trentino is an Italian province with a tourism-based economy, bordering the regions of Lombardy and Veneto, where the two earliest and largest outbreaks of COVID-19 occurred in Italy. The earliest cases in Trentino were reported in the first week of March 2020, with most of the cases occurring in the winter sport areas in the Dolomites mountain range. The number of reported cases decreased over the summer months and was followed by a second wave in the autumn and winter of 2020. Method(s): we performed high-coverage Oxford Nanopore sequencing of 253 positive SARS-CoV-2 swabs collected in Trentino between March and December 2020. Result(s): in this work, we analyzed genome sequences to trace the routes through which the virus entered the area, and assessed whether the autumnal resurgence could be attributed to lineages persisting undetected during summer, or as a consequence of new introductions. Conclusion(s): Comparing the draft genomes analyzed with a large selection of European sequences retrieved from GISAID we found that multiple introductions of the virus occurred at the early stage of the epidemics; the two epidemic waves were unrelated; the second wave was due to reintroductions of the virus in summer when traveling restrictions were uplifted.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - COVID-19 is a profoundly partisan issue in the United States. We examined whether COVID-19 partisanship extends even to children, a largely non-partisan population that may function as a reservoir for new COVID-19 variants due to low vaccination rates. Across the U.S., children (4- to 12-year-olds;N = 313) with liberal (versus conservative) parents and children living in Biden (versus Trump) voting counties reported greater mask wearing, physical distancing, and positive evaluations of these preventative health measures. Partisanship was a better predictor than education, income, religiosity, population density, and COVID-19 infection rates. Additional analyses found that the observed parent-child partisan link was driven by children’s perceptions of their parents’ guidance, behaviors, and concern about COVID-19, and was attenuated in Biden- versus Trump-voting counties. Taken together, partisanship in the U.S. appears deep enough—both at the individual and the county level—to impact children’s attitudes and behaviors, including even health behaviors during a pandemic.

AB  - BackgroundLonger-term humoral responses to two-dose COVID-19 vaccines remain incompletely characterized in people living with HIV (PLWH), as do initial responses to a third dose. MethodsWe measured antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain, ACE2 displacement and viral neutralization against wild-type and Omicron strains up to six months following two-dose vaccination, and one month following the third dose, in 99 PLWH receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy, and 152 controls. ResultsThough humoral responses naturally decline following two-dose vaccination, we found no evidence of lower antibody concentrations nor faster rates of antibody decline in PLWH compared to controls after accounting for sociodemographic, health and vaccine-related factors. We also found no evidence of poorer viral neutralization in PLWH after two doses, nor evidence that a low nadir CD4+ T-cell count compromised responses. Post-third-dose humoral responses substantially exceeded post-second-dose levels, though anti-Omicron responses were consistently weaker than against wild-type. Nevertheless, post-third-dose responses in PLWH were comparable to or higher than controls. An mRNA-1273 third dose was the strongest consistent correlate of higher post-third-dose responses. ConclusionPLWH receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy mount strong antibody responses after two- and three-dose COVID-19 vaccination. Results underscore the immune benefits of third doses in light of Omicron.

AB  - To provide a unique global view of the relative potential for evasion of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells by SARS-CoV-2 lineages as they evolve over time, we performed a comprehensive analysis of predicted HLA-I and HLA-II binding peptides in spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) protein sequences of all available SARS-CoV-2 genomes as provided by NIH NCBI at a bi-monthly interval between March and December of 2021. A data supplement of all B.1.1.529 (Omicron) genomes from GISAID in early December was also used to capture the rapidly spreading variant. A key finding is that throughout continued viral evolution and increasing rates of mutations occurring at T-cell epitope hotspots, protein instances with worst case binding loss did not become the most frequent for any Variant of Concern (VOC) or Variant of Interest (VOI) lineage; suggesting T-cell evasion is not likely to be a dominant evolutionary pressure on SARS-CoV-2. We also determined that throughout the course of the pandemic in 2021, there remained a relatively steady ratio of viral variants that exhibit conservation of epitopes in the N protein, despite significant potential for epitope loss in S relative to other lineages. We further localized conserved regions in N with high epitope yield potential, and illustrated HLA-I binding heterogeneity across the S protein consistent with empirical observations. Although Omicrons high volume of mutations caused it to exhibit more epitope loss potential than most frequently observed versions of proteins in almost all other VOCs, epitope candidates across its most frequent N proteins were still largely conserved. This analysis adds to the body of evidence suggesting that N may have merit as an additional antigen to elicit immune responses to vaccination with increased potential to provide sustained protection against COVID-19 disease in the face of emerging variants.

AB  - The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) of SARS-CoV-2 rapidly becomes dominant globally. Its extensive mutations confer severe efficacy reduction to most of existing antibodies or vaccines. Here, we developed RAMIHM, a highly efficient strategy to generate fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), directly applied it with Omicron-mRNA immunization, and isolated three potent and specific clones against Omicron. Rapid mRNA immunization elicited strong anti-Omicron antibody response in humanized mice, along with broader anti-coronavirus activity. Customized single cell BCR sequencing mapped the clonal repertoires. Top-ranked clones collectively from peripheral blood, plasma B and memory B cell populations showed high rate of Omicron-specificity (93.3%) from RAMIHM-scBCRseq. Clone-screening identified three highly potent neutralizing antibodies that have low nanomolar affinity for Omicron RBD, and low ng/mL level IC50 in neutralization, more potent than majority of currently approved or authorized clinical RBD-targeting mAbs. These lead mAbs are fully human and ready for downstream IND-enabling and/or translational studies.

AB  - The continuous emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants poses new challenges to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The newly emerging Omicron strain caused serious immune escape and raised unprecedented concern all over the world. The development of antibody targeting conserved and universal epitope is urgently needed. A subset neutralizing antibody(nAbs) against COVID-19 from convalescent patients were isolated in our previous study. Here in this study, we investigated the accommodation of these nAbs to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns (VOCs), revealing that IgG 553-49 neutralizes pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. In addition, we determined the cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike complexed with three antibodies targeting different epitopes, including 553-49, 553-15 and 553-60. Notably, 553-49 targets a novel conserved epitope and neutralizes virus by disassembling spike trimers. 553-15, an antibody that neutralizes all the other VOCs except omicron, cross-links two spike trimers to form trimer dimer, demonstrating that 553-15 neutralizes virus by steric hindrance and virion aggregation. These findings suggest the potential to develop 49 and other antibody targeting this highly conserved epitope as promising cocktail therapeutics reagent for COVID-19. ImportanceThe newly emergence of Omicron strain caused higher immune escape, raising unprecedented concerns about the effectiveness of antibody therapies and vaccines. In this study, we identified a SARS-CoV-2 Omicron neutralizing antibody 553-49, which neutralizes Omicron variant by targeting a completely conserved novel epitope. Besides, we revealed that IgG 553-15 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by crosslinking virions and 553-60 functions by blocking receptor binding. Comparison of different RBD epitopes revealed that the epitope of 553-49 is hidden in the S trimer and keeps high conservation during SARS-CoV-2 evolution, making 553-49 a promising therapeutics reagent to fight against the emerging Omicron and future variant of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The combination of cilgavimab-tixagevimab (Evusheld, Astra Zeneca) became the mainstay for protecting transplant recipients with poor response to vaccination against the omicron variant. Serum neutralizing capacity against SARS-CoV-2 is positively associated with protection against severe forms of Covid-19. Both anti-RBD IgG titers and neutralizing antibody titers against the omicron BA.1 variant were measured in serum samples collected from 63 adult kidney transplant recipients who received prophylactic injections of Evusheld. Patients who received prophylactic Ronapreve (casirivimab-imdevimab, n = 39) and those who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the fifth wave of the pandemic (n = 14) served as negative and positive controls, respectively. After a median interval from injection of 29 days (interquartile range 29-33 days), only 9.5% of patients who received Evusheld were able to neutralize the omicron variant compared to 71% of patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 2.6% of those who received Ronapreve. Interestingly, convalescent patients displayed higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than those who received EvusheldTM (median: 2.3 log IC50, IQR: 1.5-2.7 versus 0.00 log IC50, IQR: 0&[ndash] 0.05; p<0.001). A high interindividual variability in anti-RBD IgG titers was observed after Evusheld (range: 262-7032 BAU/mL). This variability was largely explained by the patientsbody mass index, which showed an inverse correlation with anti-RBD IgG titers. These findings suggest that Evusheld given at a dose of 300 mg is not sufficient to elicit an anti-RDB titer that confers in vivo neutralizing activity and support recent FDA recommendations, derived from in vitro models, regarding the need to increase the dose of Evusheld

AB  - The nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role during the viral life cycle. It is involved in RNA transcription and accounts for packaging of the large genome into virus particles. N manages the enigmatic balance of bulk RNA-coating versus precise RNA-binding to designated cis-regulatory elements. Numerous studies report the involvement of its disordered segments in non-selective RNA-recognition, but how N organizes the inevitable recognition of specific motifs remains unanswered. We here use NMR spectroscopy to systematically analyze the interactions of N’s N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NTD) with individual cis RNA elements clustering in the SARS-CoV-2 regulatory 5’-genomic end. Supported by broad solution-based biophysical data, we unravel the NTD RNA-binding preferences in the natural genome context. We show that the domain uses a set of flexible sensory residues to read the intrinsic signature of preferred RNA elements for selective and stable complex formation within the large pool of available motifs.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 transcribes a set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) essential for the translation of structural and accessory proteins to sustain its life cycle. We applied RNA-seq on 375 respiratory samples from individual COVID-19 patients and revealed that the majority of the sgRNAs were canonical transcripts with N being the most abundant (36.2%), followed by S (11.6%), open reading frame 7a (ORF7a; 10.3%), M (8.4%), ORF3a (7.9%), ORF8 (6.0%), E (4.6%), ORF6 (2.5%), and ORF7b (0.3%); but ORF10 was not detected. The profile of most sgRNAs, except N, showed an independent association with viral load, time of specimen collection after onset, age of the patient, and S-614D/G variant with ORF7b and then ORF6 being the most sensitive to changes in these characteristics. Monitoring of 124 serial samples from 10 patients using sgRNA-specific real-time RT-PCR revealed a potential of adopting sgRNA as a marker of viral activity. Respiratory samples harboring a full set of canonical sgRNAs were mainly collected early within 1 to 2weeks from onset, and most of the stool samples (90%) were negative for sgRNAs despite testing positive by diagnostic PCR targeting genomic RNA. ORF7b was the first to become undetectable and again being the most sensitive surrogate marker for a full set of canonical sgRNAs in clinical samples. The potential of using sgRNA to monitor viral activity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and hence as one of the objective indicators to triage patients for isolation and treatment should be considered. IMPORTANCE Attempts to use subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) of SARS-CoV-2 to identify active infection of COVID-19 have produced diverse results. In this work, we applied next-generation sequencing and RT-PCR to profile the full spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs in a large cohort of respiratory and stool samples collected throughout infection. Numerous known and novel discontinuous transcription events potentially encoding full-length, deleted and frameshift proteins were observed. In particular, the expression profile of canonical sgRNAs was associated with genomic RNA level and clinical characteristics. Our study found sgRNAs as potential biomarkers for monitoring infectivity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which provides an alternative target for the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUNDProtection conferred by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection versus COVID-19 vaccination has not been investigated in rigorously controlled studies. We compared head-to-head protection conferred by natural infection to that from the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines in Qatar, between February 28, 2020 and March 6, 2022. METHODSTwo national matched retrospective target-trial cohort studies were conducted to compare incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization and death among those with a documented primary infection to incidence among those with a two-dose primary-series vaccination. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. RESULTSThe overall adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) for infection was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.45-0.48) comparing those with a prior infection to those vaccinated with BNT162b2, and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.48-0.53) comparing those with a prior infection to those vaccinated with mRNA-1273. For BNT162b2, the AHR decreased gradually from 0.55 (95% CI: 0.46-0.65) in the fourth month after primary infection/vaccination to 0.31 (95% CI: 0.27-0.37) in the eighth month, while for mRNA-1273, it decreased from 0.80 (95% CI: 0.59-1.07) to 0.35 (95% CI: 0.29-0.41) over the same time period. During the Omicron wave, the AHR was [~]0.50 for BNT162b2 and [~]0.60 for mRNA-1273. The overall AHR for any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 (against all variants) was 0.32 (95% CI: 0.10-1.00) for BNT162b2, and 0.58 (95% CI: 0.14-2.43) for mRNA-1273. CONCLUSIONSNatural infection was associated with stronger and more durable protection against infection, regardless of the variant, than mRNA primary-series vaccination. Nonetheless, vaccination remains the safest and optimal tool of protection against infection and COVID-19 hospitalization and death.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The spike protein has been reported as one of the most critical targets for vaccine design strategies against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, we have designed, produced, and evaluated the potential use of three truncated recombinant proteins derived from spike protein as vaccine candidates capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 virus., METHODS: In silico tools were used to design spike-based subunit recombinant proteins (RBD (P1 ), fusion peptide (P2 ), and S1/S2 cleavage site (P3 )). These proteins were checked for their ability to be identified by the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by exposing them to COVID-19 serum samples. The proteins were also injected into mice and rabbit, and the antibody titers were measured for 390 days to assess their neutralization efficiency., RESULTS: The antibodies that existed in the serum of COVID-19 patients were identified by designed proteins. The anti-spike antibody titer was increased in the animals injected with recombinant proteins. The VNT results revealed that the produced antibodies could neutralize the cultured live virus., CONCLUSION: Truncated subunit vaccines could also be considered as robust tools for effective vaccination against COVID-19. Using a combination of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experiments, it was shown that the injection of spike-based truncated recombinant proteins could stimulate long-lasting and neutralizing antibody responses.

AB  - Variants of concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2 have caused resurging waves of infections worldwide. In the Netherlands, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants circulated widely between September 2020 and August 2021. To understand how various control measures had impacted the spread of these VOCs, we analyzed 39,844 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected under the Dutch national surveillance program. We found that all four VOCs were introduced before targeted flight restrictions were imposed on countries where the VOCs first emerged. Importantly, foreign introductions, predominantly from other European countries, continued during these restrictions. Our findings show that flight restrictions had limited effectiveness in deterring VOC introductions due to the strength of regional land travel importation risks. We also found that the Alpha and Delta variants largely circulated more populous regions with international connections after their respective introduction before asymmetric bidirectional transmissions occurred with the rest of the country and the variant dominated infections in the Netherlands. As countries consider scaling down SARS-CoV-2 surveillance efforts in the post-crisis phase of the pandemic, our results highlight that robust surveillance in regions of early spread is important for providing timely information for variant detection and outbreak control.

AB  - Importance: Previous studies have analyzed effectiveness of booster mRNA Covid-19 vaccination and compared it with 2-dose primary series for both Delta and Omicron variants. Observational studies that estimate effectiveness by comparing outcomes among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may suffer from residual confounding and exposure misclassification. Objective: To estimate relative effectiveness of booster vaccination versus the 2-dose primary series with self-controlled study design Design, Setting and Participants: We used the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Corporate Data Warehouse to identify U.S. Veterans enrolled in care [≥]2 years who received the 2-dose primary mRNA Covid-19 vaccine series and a mRNA Covid-19 booster following expanded recommendation for booster vaccination, and who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during the Delta (9/23/2021-11/30/2021) or Omicron (1/1/22-3/1/22) predominant period. Among them, we conducted a self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) analysis to compare odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a booster exposure interval versus a control interval. Exposures: control interval (days 4-6 post-booster vaccination, presumably prior to gain of booster immunity), and booster exposure interval (days 14-16 post-booster vaccination, presumably following gain of booster immunity) Outcomes and Measures: Positive PCR or antigen SARS-CoV-2 test. Separately for Delta and Omicron periods, we used conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) of a positive test for the booster versus control interval and calculated relative effectiveness of booster versus 2-dose primary series as (1-OR)*100. The SCRI approach implicitly controlled for time-fixed confounders. Results: We found 42 individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the control interval and 14 in the booster exposure interval during Delta period, and 137 and 66, respectively, in Omicron period. For the booster versus 2-dose primary series, the odds of infection were 70% (95%CI: 42%, 84%) lower during the Delta period and 56% (95%CI: 38%, 67%) lower during Omicron. Results were similar for ages <65 and [≥]65 years in the Omicron period. In sensitivity analyses among those with prior Covid-19 history, and age stratification, ORs were similar to the main analysis. Conclusions: Booster vaccination was more effective relative to a 2-dose primary series, the relative effectiveness was consistent across age groups and was higher during the Delta predominant period than during the Omicron period.

AB  - ObjectivesThe rapid spread of the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) alongside evidence of a relatively rapid waning of the third dose prompted Israel to administer a fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine on January 2022. Thus far, sufficient real-world evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of a fourth dose against infection and severe COVID-19 are lacking. This study examined the short-term effectiveness of a fourth dose compared to three doses over the span of 10 weeks. DesignA retrospective test-negative case-control study, performing both a matched analysis and an unmatched multiple-tests analysis. SettingNationally centralized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), an Israeli national health fund that covers 2.5 million people. ParticipantsThe study population included 97,499 MHS members aged 60 or older who were eligible to receive a fourth vaccine dose and performed at least one PCR test during the study period. Of them, 27,876 received the fourth dose and 69,623 received only three doses. Main outcomes and measuresAnalyses focused on the period from January 10, 2022 (7 days after the fourth dose was first administered to eligible individuals) to March 13, 2022, an Omicron-dominant period in Israel. We evaluated two SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes: (1) breakthrough infection, defined as a positive PCR test performed 7 or more days after inoculation with the BNT162b2 vaccine; and (2) breakthrough infection resulting in a severe disease, defined as COVID-19-related hospitalization or COVID-19 associated mortality. ResultsA fourth dose provided considerable additional protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease relative to three doses of the vaccine. However, vaccine effectiveness against infection varied over time, peaking during the third week with a VE of 64% (95% CI: 62.0%-65.9%) and declining to 29.2% (95% CI: 17.7%-39.1%) by the end of the 10-week follow-up period. Unlike VE against infection, the relative effectiveness of a fourth dose against severe COVID-19 was maintained at high level (>73%) throughout the 9-week follow-up period. Importantly, severe disease was a relatively rare event, occurring in <1% of both fourth dose and third dose only recipients. ConclusionsA fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine provided considerable additional protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease relative to three doses of the vaccine. However, effectiveness of the fourth dose against infection wanes sooner than that of the third dose.

AB  - Omicron variant strains encode large numbers of changes in the spike protein compared to historical SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Although in vitro studies have suggested that several monoclonal antibody therapies lose neutralizing activity against Omicron variants1-4, the effects in vivo remain largely unknown. Here, we report on the protective efficacy against three SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineage strains (BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2) of two monoclonal antibody therapeutics (S309 [Vir Biotechnology] monotherapy and AZD7442 [AstraZeneca] combination), which correspond to ones used to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. Despite losses in neutralization potency in cell culture, S309 or AZD7442 treatments reduced BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2 lung infection in susceptible mice that express human ACE2 (K18-hACE2). Correlation analyses between in vitro neutralizing activity and reductions in viral burden in K18-hACE2 or human Fc{gamma} R transgenic mice suggest that S309 and AZD7442 have different mechanisms of protection against Omicron variants, with S309 utilizing Fc effector function interactions and AZD7442 acting principally by direct neutralization. Our data in mice demonstrate the resilience of S309 and AZD7442 mAbs against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant strains and provide insight into the relationship between loss of antibody neutralization potency and retained protection in vivo.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swabs is a key component in the COVID-19 fighting, provided to use sensitive and specific SARS-CoV2 genome targets. In this study, we aimed to evaluate and to compare 4 widely used WHO approved RT-PCR protocols on real clinical specimens, to decrypt the reasons of the diverging results and to propose recommendations for the choice of the genome targets., METHODS: 260 nasopharyngeal samples were randomly selected among the samples tested between Week-16, 2020 and week-16 2021, in the Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Tunisia, one of the referent laboratories of COVID-19 in Tunisia. All samples were tested by Charite, Berlin protocol (singleplex envelop (E) and singleplex RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)), Hong Kong Universiy, China protocol (singleplex nucleoprotein (N) and singleplex Open reading frame Orf1b), commercial test DAAN Gene R (using the CDC China protocol), (triplex N, Orf1ab with internal control) and Institut Pasteur Paris protocol (IPP) (triplex IP2(nsp9) and IP4 (nsp12) with internal control). For IPP, a selection from samples positive by IP2 but negative with IP4 was re-tested by exactly the same protocol but this time in singleplex. New results were described and analyzed., RESULTS: In vitro analysis showed discordant results in 29.2% of cases (76 out of 260). The most discordant protocol is DAAN Gene R due to the false positive late signals with N target. Discordant results between the two protocol's targets are more frequent when viral load are low (high Ct values). Our results demonstrated that the multiplexing has worsened the sensitivity of the IP4 target., CONCLUSION: We provide concise recommendations for the choice of the genome targets, the interpretation of the results and the alarm signals which makes suspect a gene mutation.

AB  - Late 2020, SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant emerged in United Kingdom and gradually replaced G614 strains initially involved in the global spread of the pandemic. In this study, we use a Syrian hamster model to compare a clinical strain of Alpha variant with an ancestral G614 strain. The Alpha variant succeed to infect animals and to induce a pathology that mimics COVID-19. However, both strains replicate to almost the same level and induced a comparable disease and immune response. A slight fitness advantage is noted for the G614 strain during competition and transmission experiments. These data do not corroborate the epidemiological situation observed during the first half of 2021 in humans nor reports that showed a more rapid replication of Alpha variant in human reconstituted bronchial epithelium. This study highlights the need to combine data from different laboratories using various animal models to decipher the biological properties of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Copyright © 2022.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant exhibits very high levels of transmission, pronounced resistance to authorized therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies and reduced sensitivity to vaccine-induced immunity. Here we describe P2G3, a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) isolated from a previously infected and vaccinated donor, which displays picomolar-range neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2 and all other current variants, and is thus markedly more potent than all authorized or clinically advanced anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs. Structural characterization of P2G3 Fab in complex with the Omicron Spike demonstrates unique binding properties to both down and up spike trimer conformations at an epitope that partially overlaps with the receptor-binding domain (RBD), yet is distinct from those bound by all other characterized mAbs. This distinct epitope and angle of attack allows P2G3 to overcome all the Omicron mutations abolishing or impairing neutralization by other anti-SARS-COV-2 mAbs, and P2G3 accordingly confers complete prophylactic protection in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron monkey challenge model. Finally, although we could isolate in vitro SARS-CoV2 mutants escaping neutralization by P2G3 or by P5C3, a previously described broadly active Class 1 mAb, we found these viruses to be lowly infectious and their key mutations extremely rare in the wild, and we could demonstrate that P2G3/P5C3 efficiently cross-neutralized one anothers escapees. We conclude that this combination of mAbs has great prospects in both the prophylactic and therapeutic settings to protect from Omicron and other VOCs.

AB  - This study describes a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak caused by the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in a nursing home in Central Italy during October-November 2021. Trained interviewers collected data from residents, staff, and administration officers with an agreed informed consent procedure. Thirty-two (44.5%) out of 72 residents (median age 89 years) and six (26.1%) of 23 healthcare workers were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infections occurred more often among residents with a higher index of independence in daily living activities, suggesting an increased risk for those with more interactions. Twenty-five infected residents (78.1%) received the booster dose of mRNA anti-COVID-19 vaccine > 7 days before SARS-CoV-2 onset. Half of the infected residents had mild symptoms, and only three required hospitalisation, one of whom died from COVID-19 complications. The study underlines the effectiveness of a booster dose in providing a high protection against severe disease and hospitalisation even among vulnerable individuals infected with the Delta variant of concern.

AB  - Since the end of 2019 a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, first identified in Wuhan, China, is spreading around the world partially associated with a high death toll. Besides hygienic measurements to reduce the spread of the virus vaccines have been confected, partially based on the experiences with Ebola virus vaccine, based on recombinant human or chimpanzee adenovirus carrying the spike protein and its ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD). Further vaccines are constructed by spike protein coding mRNA incorporated in lipid nano vesicles that after entry in human cells produce spike protein. Both vaccine types induce a strong immune response that lasts for months possibly for T-cell immunity a few years. Due to mutations in the coronavirus genome in several parts of the world variants selected, that were partially more pathogenic and partially easier transmissible - variants of concern (VOC). Until now vaccinees are protected against the VOC, even when protection might be reduced compared to the Wuhan wild virus.An open field is still how long the vaccine induced immunity will be sufficient to prevent infection and/or disease; and how long the time period will last until revaccination will be required for life saving protection, whether a third vaccination is needed, and whether revaccination with an adenovirus-based vaccine will be tolerated.

AB  - This is the case report of an 84-year-old man affected by COVID-19 between the 2 doses of vaccination, with negative exitus. We analyzed nasopharyngeal samples of viral RNA collected during the disease and nasopharyngeal and lung samples collected postmortem by reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) PCR and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). NGS results were analyzed with different bioinformatic tools to define virus lineages and the related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Both lung and nasopharyngeal samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-LAMP. Through bioinformatic analysis, 2 viral RNAs from the nasal swabs, which belonged to the B.1.1.7 lineage, and 1 viral RNA from the lung sample, which belonged to the B.1.533 lineage, were identified. This genetic observation suggested that SARS-CoV-2 tends to change under selective pressure. The high mutation rate of ORFa1b, containing a replicase gene, was a biological image of a complex viral survival system.Copyright © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in cell entry, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein is highly conserved among human coronavirus homologs. For potentially broad effectiveness against both original virus and emerging variants, we developed alphavirus-based self-amplifying mRNA (sa-mRNA) SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: an sa-mRNA S encoding a full-length S protein stabilized in a prefusion conformation and an sa-mRNA S-N co-expressing S and N proteins for the original virus. We show that these sa-mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines raised potent neutralizing antibody responses in mice against not only the original virus but also the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants. sa-mRNA S vaccines against the alpha and beta variants also raised robust cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses against their homologous viruses and heterologous variants. sa-mRNA S and sa-mRNA S-N vaccines elicited Th1-dominant, antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses to S and N proteins and robust and broad CD8+ T cell responses to S protein. Hamsters immunized with either vaccine were fully protected from lung infection and showed significant reduction of viral load in upper respiratory tract. Our findings demonstrate that sa-mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are potent in animal models with potential to be highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - mRNA vaccines were the first to be authorized for use against SARS-CoV-2 and have since demonstrated high efficacy against serious illness and death. However, limitations in these vaccines have been recognized due to their requirement for cold storage, short durability of protection, and lack of access in low-resource regions. We have developed an easily-manufactured, potent self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that is stable at room temperature. This saRNA vaccine is formulated with a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC), providing enhanced stability, improved manufacturability, and protection against degradation. In preclinical studies, this saRNA/NLC vaccine induced strong humoral immunity, as demonstrated by high pseudovirus neutralization titers to the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants of concern and induction of long-lived bone marrow-resident antibody secreting cells. Robust Th1-biased T-cell responses were also observed after prime or homologous prime-boost in mice. Notably, the saRNA/NLC platform demonstrated thermostability at room temperature for at least 6 months when lyophilized. Taken together, this saRNA delivered by NLC represents a potential improvement in RNA technology that could allow wider access to RNA vaccines for the current COVID-19 and future pandemics.

AB  - Genetic recombination is a major evolutionary mechanism among RNA viruses, and it is common in coronaviruses, including those infecting humans. A few SARS-CoV-2 recombinants have been reported to date whose genome harbored combinations of mutations from different mutants or variants, but a single patients sample was analyzed, and the virus was not isolated. Here, we re-port the gradual creation of a hybrid genome of B.1.160 and Alpha variants in a lymphoma patient chronically infected for 14 months, and we isolated the recombinant virus. The hybrid genome was obtained by next-generation sequencing, and recombination sites were confirmed by PCR. This consisted of a parental B.1.160 backbone interspersed with two fragments, including the spike gene, from an Alpha variant. Analysis of seven sequential samples from the patient decoded the recombination steps, including the initial infection with a B.1.160 variant, then a concurrent infec-tion with this variant and an Alpha variant, the generation of hybrid genomes, and eventually the emergence of a predominant recombinant virus isolated at the end of the patients follow-up. This case exemplifies the recombination process of SARS-CoV-2 in real life, and it calls for intensifying genomic surveillance in patients coinfected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants, and more gener-ally with several RNA viruses, as this may lead to the creation of new viruses.

AB  - We aimed to search for laboratory predictors of critical COVID-19 in consecutive adults admitted in an academic center between 16 September 2020-20 December 2021. Patients were uniformly treated with low-molecular-weight heparin, and dexamethasone plus remdesivir when SpO2 < 94%. Among consecutive unvaccinated patients without underlying medical conditions (n = 241, 49 year-old median, 71% males), 22 (9.1%) developed critical disease and 2 died (0.8%). White-blood-cell counts, neutrophils, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, CRP, fibrinogen, ferritin, LDH and gamma-GT at admission were each univariably associated with critical disease. ROC-defined cutoffs revealed that CRP > 61.8 mg/L, fibrinogen >616.5 mg/dL and LDH > 380.5 U/L were each associated with critical disease development, independently of age, sex and days from symptom-onset. A score combining higher-than-cutoff CRP (0/2), LDH (0/1) and fibrinogen (0/1) predicted critical disease (AUC: 0.873, 95% CI: 0.820-0.926). This score performed well in an unselected patient cohort (n = 1228, 100% unvaccinated) predominantly infected by the alpha variant (AUC: 0.718, 95% CI: 0.683-0.753), as well as in a mixed cohort (n = 527, 65% unvaccinated) predominantly infected by the delta variant (AUC: 0.708, 95% CI: 0.656-0.760). Therefore, we propose that a combination of standard biomarkers of acute inflammatory response, cell death and hypercoagulability reflects the severity of COVID-19 per se independently of comorbidities, age and sex, being of value for risk stratification in unselected patients.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: HIV-infection is known to aggravate the course of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19. International guidance recommends vaccination of HIV+ individuals against SARS-CoV-2. There is a paucity of data on epidemiological efficacy assessment of COVID-19 vaccines among HIV+. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of Sputnik V vaccine effectiveness in HIV+ patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Method(s): We performed a retrospective cohort study to assess the effectiveness of the standard Sputnik V vaccination regimen in 24,423 HIV+ Moscow residents during spring - summer 2021, that included dominance of delta variant, with estimation of hospitalization and severe illness rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Data were extracted from the Moscow anti-COVID-19 vaccination and COVID-19 incidence Registries. Finding(s): The data obtained indicate that Sputnik V epidemiological efficiency in the entire cohort of HIV+ on ART was 76.33%; in HIV+ with CD4+ >= 350 cells/microl, vaccine efficiency was 79.42%, avoiding hospitalization in 90.12% cases and protecting from the development of moderate or severe disease in 97.06%. For delta variant in this group the efficiency was 65.35%, avoiding the need for hospitalization in 75.77% cases and protecting from the development of moderate or severe disease in 93.05% of patients. There was a trend, although not statistically significant, of declining vaccine efficiency in immune-compromised individuals (CD4+ < 350 cells/microl). Interpretation(s): The study suggested epidemiological efficiency of immunization with Sputnik V in HIV+ ART-treated patients for the original and delta SARS-CoV-2 variants.

AB  - The impact of SARS-CoV2 vaccination in cancer patients remains incompletely understood given the heterogeneity of cancer and cancer therapies. We assessed vaccine-induced antibody response to the SARS-CoV2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant in 57 patients with B cell malignancies with and without active B cell-targeted therapy. Ancestral- and Omicron-reactive antibody levels were determined by ELISA and neutralization assays. In over one third of vaccinated patients at the pre-booster timepoint, there were no ELISA-detectable antibodies against either the ancestral strain or Omicron variant. The lack of vaccine-induced antibodies was predominantly in patients receiving active therapy such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or Brutons tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi). While booster immunization was able to induce detectable antibodies in a small fraction of seronegative patients, the benefit was disproportionately evident in patients not on active therapy. Importantly, in patients with post-booster ELISA-detectable antibodies, there was a positive correlation of antibody levels against the ancestral strain and Omicron variant. Booster immunization increased overall antibody levels, including neutralizing antibody titers against the ancestral strain and Omicron variant; however, predominantly in patients without active therapy. Furthermore, ancestral strain neutralizing antibody titers were about 5-fold higher in comparison with those to Omicron, suggesting that even with booster administration, there may be reduced protection against the Omicron variant. Interestingly, in almost all patients regardless of active therapy, including those unable to generate detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV2 spike, we observed comparable levels of EBV, influenza, and common cold coronavirus reactive antibodies demonstrating that B cell-targeting therapies primarily impair de novo but not pre-existing antibody levels. These findings suggest that patients with B cell malignancies on active therapy may be at disproportionately higher risk to new versus endemic viral infection and suggest utility for vaccination prior to B cell-targeted therapy.

AB  - Equitable access to vaccines is necessary to limit the global impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the emergence of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. In previous studies, we described the development of a low-cost vaccine based on a Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) expressing the prefusion stabilized spike protein from SARS-CoV-2, named NDV-HXP-S. Here, we present the development of next-generation NDV-HXP-S variant vaccines, which express the stabilized spike protein of the Beta, Gamma and Delta variants of concerns (VOC). Combinations of variant vaccines in bivalent, trivalent and tetravalent formulations were tested for immunogenicity and protection in mice. We show that the trivalent preparation, composed of the ancestral Wuhan, Beta and Delta vaccines, substantially increases the levels of protection and of cross-neutralizing antibodies against mismatched, phylogenetically distant variants, including the currently circulating Omicron variant.

AB  - A new variant named Omicron (B.1.1.529), first identified in South Africa, has become of considerable interest to the World Health Organization. This variant differs from the other known major variants, as it carries a large number of unusual mutations, particularly in the spinous process protein and receptor binding domains. Some specific mutation sites make it vaccine resistant, highly infectious, and highly pathogenic. The world fears that the Omicron variant could be even more harmful than the previous major variant, given that it has emerged amid fierce competition to trigger a new global pandemic peak as infections in South Africa rise. However, some epidemiological evidence has emerged that the Omicron variant may produce milder patient symptoms. We speculate if the virulence of the Omicron variant will diminish as transmissibility increases, thereby signaling the beginning of the end for the global COVID-19 pandemic. Based on this view, we make recommendations for COVID-19 mitigation in the present and future. However, it will take a few weeks to determine the true threat posed by the Omicron variant and we need to be fully prepared for future outbreaks, regardless of their severity.

AB  - Ultrastructural studies of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells are crucial to better understand the mechanisms of viral entry and budding within host cells. Here, we examined human airway epithelium infected with three different isolates of SARS-CoV-2 including the B.1.1.7 variant by transmission electron microscopy and tomography. For all isolates, the virus infected ciliated but not goblet epithelial cells. Key SARS-CoV-2 entry molecules, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, were found to be localised to the plasma membrane including microvilli but excluded from cilia. Consistently, extracellular virions were seen associated with microvilli and the apical plasma membrane but rarely with ciliary membranes. Profiles indicative of viral fusion where tomography showed that the viral membrane was continuous with the apical plasma membrane and the nucleocapsids diluted, compared with unfused virus, demonstrate that the plasma membrane is one site of entry where direct fusion releasing the nucleoprotein-encapsidated genome occurs. Intact intracellular virions were found within ciliated cells in compartments with a single membrane bearing S glycoprotein. Tomography showed concentration of nucleocapsids round the periphery of profiles strongly suggestive of viral budding into these compartments and this may explain how virions gain their S glycoprotein containing envelope.

AB  - The current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic wreaks medical and socioeconomic havoc. Despite the availability of vaccines, cost-effective acute treatment options preventing morbidity and mortality are urgently needed. To identify affordable, ubiquitously available, and effective treatments, we tested herbs consumed worldwide as herbal teas regarding their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Aqueous infusions prepared by boiling leaves of the Lamiaceae perilla and sage elicit potent and sustained antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in therapeutic as well as prophylactic regimens. The herbal infusions exerted antiviral effects comparable to interferon-{beta} and remdesivir but outperformed convalescent sera and interferon-2 upon short-term treatment early after infection. Based on protein fractionation analyses, we identified caffeic acid, perilla aldehyde, and perillyl alcohol as antiviral compounds. Global mass spectrometry (MS) analyses performed comparatively in two different cell culture infection models revealed changes of the proteome upon treatment with herbal infusions and provided insights into the mode of action. As inferred by the MS data, induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX-1) was confirmed as effector mechanism by the antiviral activity of the HMOX-1-inducing compounds sulforaphane and fraxetin. In conclusion, herbal teas based on perilla and sage exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 including variants of concern such as Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron.

The transmission route was explored and the clinical data of two groups were compared; The effect factors for the time of the nucleic acid negativization (NAN) were examined by R statistical analysis., Results: The Delta surge in Putian spread from children in schools to factories, mostly through family contact. Compared with those aged >= 12y, patients aged < 12y accounted for 34.07% of the total and showed milder fever, less cough and fatigue; they reported higher peripheral blood lymphocyte counts [1.84 (1.32, 2.71)x10^9/L vs. 1.31 (0.94, 1.85)x10^9/L; p<0.05), higher normal CRP rate (92.21% vs. 57.72%), lower IL-6 levels [5.28 (3.31, 8.13) vs. 9.10 (4.37, 15.14); p<0.05]. Upon admission, their COVID19 antibodies (IgM and IgG) and IgG in convalescence were lower [0.13 (0.00, 0.09) vs. 0.12 (0.03, 0.41), p<0.05; 0.02 (0.00, 0.14) vs. 1.94 (0.54, 6.40), p<0.05; 5.46 (2.41, 9.26) vs. 73.63 (54.63, 86.55), p<0.05, respectively], but longer NAN time (18 days vs. 16 days, p=0.13)., Conclusion: Unvaccinated children may be an important link in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B1.617.2), which indicated an urgent need of vaccination for this particular population.

AB  - The process of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic diversification is still ongoing and has very recently led to the emergence of a new variant of concern (VOC), defined as Omicron or B.1.1.529. Omicron VOC is the most divergent variant identified so far and has generated immediate concern for its potential capability to increase SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and, more worryingly, to escape therapeutic and vaccine-induced antibodies. Nevertheless, a clear definition of the Omicron VOC mutational spectrum is still missing. Herein, we provide a comprehensive definition and functional characterization (in terms of infectivity and/or antigenicity) of mutations characterizing the Omicron VOC. In particular, 887,475 SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC whole-genome sequences were retrieved from the GISAID database and used to precisely define its specific patterns of mutations across the different viral proteins. In addition, the functional characterization of Omicron VOC spike mutations was finely discussed according to published manuscripts. Lastly, residues characterizing the Omicron VOC and the previous four VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) were mapped on the three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to assess their localization in the different spike domains. Overall, our study will assist with deciphering the Omicron VOC mutational profile and will shed more light on its clinical implications. This is critical considering that Omicron VOC is currently the predominant variant worldwide. IMPORTANCE The Omicron variant of concern (VOC) has a peculiar spectrum of mutations characterized by the acquisition of mutations or deletions rarely detected in previously identified variants, particularly in the spike glycoprotein. Such mutations, mostly residing in the receptor-binding domain, could play a pivotal role in enhancing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity (by increasing binding affinity for ACE2), jeopardizing spike recognition by therapeutic and vaccine-induced antibodies and causing diagnostic assay failure. To our knowledge, this is one of the first exhaustive descriptions of newly emerged mutations underlying the Omicron VOC and its biological and clinical implications.

AB  - BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccination was recommended for adolescents in Norway since August 2021. In this population-based cohort study, we estimated the BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against any PCR-confirmed (symptomatic or not) SARS-CoV-2 infections caused by the Delta and Omicron variant among adolescents (12-17-years-old) in Norway from August 2021 to January 2022. MethodsUsing Cox proportional hazard models, we estimated the BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against any Delta and Omicron infections. Vaccine status was included as a time-varying covariate and models were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, county of residence, country of birth, and living conditions. Data were obtained from the National Preparedness registry for COVID-19, which contains individual-level data from national health and administrative registries. FindingsVaccine effectiveness against Delta infection peaked at 68% (95%CI: 64-71%) and 62% (95%CI: 57- 66%) in days 21-48 after the first dose among 12-15-year-olds and 16-17-year-olds respectively. Among 16-17-year-olds that received two doses, vaccine effectiveness peaked at 93% (95%CI: 90-95%) in days 35-62 and declined to 84% (95%CI: 76-89%) in 63 days or more after the second dose. For both age-groups, we found no protection against Omicron infection after receiving one dose. Among 16-17-year-olds, vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infection peaked at 53% (95%CI: 43-62%) in 7-34 days after the second dose and decreased to 23% (95%CI: 3-40%) in 63 days or more after vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness decreased with time since vaccination for both variants, but waning was observed to occur faster for Omicron. InterpretationOur results suggest reduced protection from BNT162b2 vaccination against any SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the Omicron variant compared to the Delta. In addition, waning immunity was observed to occur faster for Omicron. The impact of vaccination among adolescents on reducing infection and thus transmission is limited during omicron dominance. FundingNo funding was received. Research in context Evidence before this studyBNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Spikevax, Moderna) vaccines have been approved for use in adolescents, based on results from randomized placebo-controlled trials demonstrating comparable immunogenicity and safety profile as in young adults. In addition, observational studies from Israel, the USA and England have reported high protection of BNT162b2 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 Delta infection among adolescents. These studies also reported decrease in effectiveness with time since last vaccine dose. Evidence on the effect of an extended interval between doses, longer time since vaccination and the effect against different variants is limited. When we first planned this study in early February 2022, no data were available regarding vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection among adolescents. To our knowledge when we completed this study and before submitting this article, only one study from England reported results in a preprint on vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection among adolescents. We searched for studies that evaluated vaccine efficacy or effectiveness after vaccination of adolescents during 2021-2022 in PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN. We searched for studies with several variations of the primary key search terms "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", and "vaccine" (including names of specific vaccines, as BNT162b2), "vaccine effectiveness", "adolescents", "children". Added value of this studyThe rapid increase in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the Omicron variant in highly vaccinated populations has raised concerns about the effectiveness of current vaccines in adults but also adolescents. In this population-based cohort study, we showed that the vaccine effectiveness against Omicron is lower than against Delta infections among adolescents, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. We should note that evidence suggests higher rates of asymptomatic carriage for O icron than other variants of concern. Vaccine effectiveness that includes asymptomatic cases, as in the study from England, is expected to be lower than when including symptomatic cases only. We found that one and two doses of BNT162b2 among adolescents protected well against Delta. Vaccination provided high protection against Delta infections (>91%) among Norwegian 16-17-year-olds 7-62 days after the second dose. We found no protection against Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection after one vaccine dose, and moderate effectiveness after two doses (peaked at 53%) among the 16-17-year-olds. Moreover, waning immunity was observed to occur faster for Omicron. Implications of all the available evidenceBased on the available evidence, the vaccine effectiveness among adolescents is similar to that reported among adults, also with an extended period of 8-12 weeks between doses which was used in Norway. Protection is significantly lower against Omicron than Delta infections and immunity wanes faster against Omicron. The impact of vaccination among adolescents on reducing infection and thus transmission is limited during omicron dominance. Policies should take into account the impact of vaccination campaigns among adolescents and their primary objective. Vaccine effectiveness should be re-evaluated when other variants appear as they might have different outcomes as shown between Delta and Omicron infections.

AB  - Background: In this serosurveillance study, we investigated the variation of total anti-SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) antibodies in healthcare workers receiving primary BNT162b2 vaccination and homologous booster. Methods: : A total number of 524 subjects (median age, 46 years;65.3% females), were studied. All received primary BNT162b2 vaccination (two doses) and homologous booster (one dose) &gt;8 months after completing the primary cycle. Blood samples were collected before the first and second vaccine doses, at 1, 3 and 6 months after the second dose, as well as before and 1 month after booster. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were assayed with Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S chemiluminescent immunoassay. Results: : Overall, 65.1% subjects were baseline (i.e., prevaccination) SARS-CoV-2 seronegative and always tested SARS-CoV-2 negative (“N/N”), 16.2% were baseline SARS-CoV-2 seronegative but tested SARS-CoV-2 positive after receiving the vaccine booster dose (“N/P”), whilst 18.7% were baseline SARS-CoV-2 seropositive and always tested SARS-CoV-2 negative afterwards (“P/N”). All groups displayed a similar trend of total anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies throughout the study period, though the P/N cohort exhibited higher values compared to the other two groups until receiving the booster, after which the levels become similar in all cohorts. Significant differences in total anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies values were not found between N/N and N/P groups, neither 1 month after booster. The rate of subjects with protective antibodies values become 100% in all groups after booster. Conclusions: : Although baseline seropositivity is associated with more pronounced humoral immune response following primary vaccination compared to never infected subjects, SARS-CoV-2 infection after booster does not significantly foster antibody titers.

AB  - An important, and often neglected, aspect of vaccine effectiveness is its impact on pathogen transmissibility, harboring major implications for public health policies. As viral load is a prominent factor affecting infectivity, its laboratory surrogate, qRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct), can be used to investigate the infectivity-related component of vaccine effectiveness. While vaccine waning has previously been observed for viral load, during the Delta wave, it is yet unknown how Omicron viral load is affected by vaccination status, and whether vaccine-derived and natural infection protection are sustainable. By analyzing results of more than 460,000 individuals we show that while recent vaccination reduces Omicron viral load, its effect wanes rapidly. In contrast, a significantly slower waning rate is demonstrated for recovered COVID-19 individuals. Thus, while the vaccine is effective in decreasing morbidity and mortality, their relative minute effect on transmissibility and rapid waning call for reassessment of the scientific justification for "vaccine certificate", as it may promote false reassurance and promiscuous behavior.

AB  - The continued progression of the COVID-19 pandemic can partly be attributed to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to mutate and introduce new viral variants. Some of these variants with the potential to spread quickly and conquer the globe are termed variants of concern (VOC). The existing vaccines implemented on a global scale are based on the ancestral strain, which has resulted in increased numbers of breakthrough infections as these VOC have emerged. It is imperative to show protection against VOC infection with newly developed vaccines. Previously, we evaluated two vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone (VSV-SARS2) or in combination with the Ebola virus glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV) and demonstrated their fast-acting potential. Here, we prolonged the time to challenge; we vaccinated hamsters intranasally (IN) or intramuscularly 28 days prior to infection with three SARS-CoV-2 VOC-the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants. IN vaccination with either the VSV-SARS2 or VSV-SARS2-EBOV resulted in the highest protective efficacy as demonstrated by decreased virus shedding and lung viral load of vaccinated hamsters. Histopathologic analysis of the lungs revealed the least amount of lung damage in the IN-vaccinated animals regardless of the challenge virus. This data demonstrates the ability of a VSV-based vaccine to not only protect from disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 VOC but also reduce viral shedding.Copyright © 2022 by the author.

AB  - BackgroundThe rate at which COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness wanes over time is crucial for vaccination policies, but is incompletely understood with conflicting results from different studies. MethodsThis cohort study, using the OpenSAFELY-TPP database and approved by NHS England, included individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection assigned to vaccines priority groups 2-12 defined by the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. We compared individuals who had received two doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 with unvaccinated individuals during six 4-week comparison periods, separately for subgroups aged 65+ years; 16-64 years and clinically vulnerable; 40-64 years and 18-39 years. We used Cox regression, stratified by first dose eligibility and geographical region and controlled for calendar time, to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing vaccinated with unvaccinated individuals, and quantified waning vaccine effectiveness as ratios of aHRs per-4-week period. The outcomes were COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death, positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and non-COVID-19 death. FindingsThe BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 and unvaccinated groups comprised 1,773,970, 2,961,011 and 2,433,988 individuals, respectively. Waning of vaccine effectiveness was similar across outcomes and vaccine brands: e.g. in the 65+ years subgroup ratios of aHRs versus unvaccinated for COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death and positive SARS-CoV-2 test ranged from 1.23 (95% CI 1.15-1.32) to 1.27 (1.20-1.34) for BNT162b2 and 1.16 (0.98-1.37) to 1.20 (1.14-1.27) for ChAdOx1. Despite waning, rates of COVID-19 hospitalisation and COVID-19 death were substantially lower among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals up to 26 weeks after second dose, with estimated aHRs <0.20 (>80% vaccine effectiveness) for BNT162b2, and <0.26 (>74%) for ChAdOx1. By weeks 23-26, rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated individuals were similar to or higher than those in unvaccinated individuals: aHRs ranged from 0.85 (0.78-0.92) to 1.53 (1.07-2.18) for BNT162b2, and 1.21 (1.13-1.30) to 1.99 (1.94-2.05) for ChAdOx1. InterpretationThe rate at which estimated vaccine effectiveness waned was strikingly consistent for COVID-19 hospitalisation, COVID-19 death and positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and similar across subgroups defined by age and clinical vulnerability. If sustained to outcomes of infection with the Omicron variant and to booster vaccination, these findings will facilitate scheduling of booster vaccination doses.

AB  - AIMS: Despite high vaccination rates, increasing case numbers continue to be reported with the identification of new variants of concern, and the issue of durability of the vaccine-induced immune response remains hot topic. Real-life data regarding time-dependent immunogenicity of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines are scarce. We aimed to investigate the changes in the antibody at the different times after the second dose of the CoronaVac vaccine., METHODS: The study included 175 HCWs vaccinated with inactive CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Sciences, China) SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in two doses. Anti-spike/RBD IgG levels were measured first, third, and sixth months after the second dose. Chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (IgG II Quant test, Abbott, USA), which is 100% compatible with plaque reduction neutralization test, was used., RESULTS: Mean age of the participants was 38 +/- 11.23 years (range between 22 and 66) of whom 119 (63.9%) were female, and 56 (32%) were male. Dramatic reductions were demonstrated in median antibody levels particularly in the infection-naive group, comprising 138 HCWs compared to those with prior history of COVID-19 infection (n = 37) (p < 0.001). There was no difference between the two groups in terms of age, gender, blood groups, BMI, and comorbid diseases., CONCLUSIONS: While antibody positivity remained above 90% in the 6th month after two doses of inactivated vaccine in HCWs, the median titers of neutralizing antibodies decreased rapidly. The decrease was more rapid and significant in those with no history of prior COVID-19 infection. In this critical phase of the pandemic, where we are facing the dominance of the Omicron variant after Delta, booster doses have become vital. Copyright © 2022.

AB  - Background: In January 2020, a previously unknown coronavirus strain was identified as the cause of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). The first viral whole-genome was sequenced using high-throughput sequencing from a sample collected in Wuhan, China. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is imperative in investigating disease outbreak transmission dynamics and guiding decision-making in public health.
